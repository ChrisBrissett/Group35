		<h1>Risks</h1>
		<div class="container">
			<p>In any project large or small, there will always be risks associated. Many of these risks are avoidable
				if a plan is made and these risks identified early on, often recognised during a risk assessment with a
				risk/hazard matrix suitable for the tasks. </p>
			<p>Thorough research on tools used in our project will alleviate or significantly reduce risk that could
				lead to project down time, or late delivery. As our project is completed online through collaboration
				tools such as Microsoft Teams and Discord, we rest easy knowing that the data that we store and enter
				here is secure and backed up to the cloud consistently. These cloud services are mirrored around the
				globe, allowing for true redundancy, and ability to work anywhere at any time, even without an internet
				connection. </p>
			<p>As our team is quite young, we are continually developing our teamwork and collaboration skills. We
				acknowledge that there may be limitations with our reach or the knowledge that we have within the ICT
				world, but as a team, our wingspan is great. With our 5 members working in very different fields, we are
				confident with our ability to research tools, and identify what is best for our group and the project at
				hand. </p>
			<p>Some of the consequences that are associated with development of a mobile application are changes to the
				schedule, unfinished tasks that are assigned to team members, overloading or underloading team members
				and total re-writes of the app. To mitigate the abovementioned risks, our team will analyse what kind of
				impact this may have on the team or the project itself. It will allow us as a team to develop strategies
				to avoid the chance of catastrophe. </p>
			<p>One risk that our group aim to avoid for this project is unplanned absences of team members. This leads
				to delays in completion of individual and group tasks, demotivation, disorganisation and gaps in
				knowledge when other team members try to pick up the slack. Our team have committed their time to
				delivering a solid project for assignment 3 and look forward to seeing it grow from what it is today.

		<h1>Group Processes and Communications</h1>
		<div class="container">
			<p>Based on our group and individual reflections from Assignment 2, we have made a few adjustments to our
				meeting schedule and agendas. <br>

				We have elected to meet formally once a week on Tuesday evenings for anywhere from 45mins to an hour,
				more if everyone is comfortable and we’re making good progress. We do this using Microsoft Teams
				meetings from there we can share our screens and review our report together. We also have informal catch
				ups which can last 10-20 minutes on any day we deem its needed, often before a due date, or when members
				are stuck on what to do next. Frequent text-based communication throughout the week is also encouraged
				through either discord or Microsoft Teams. If we are unable to contact a team member through Discord or
				Microsoft Teams, we will send an email to their school address and inform our tutor. Important notes
				from a meeting or other development they may have missed, will be kept and passed on to them as soon as
				possible.</p>

			<p>Over the next 6 months we aim to have a refined rendition of our app, with both clue-keeping,
				scorekeeping, and card management available. It will be up on both Google play, and Apple app stores,
				with plenty of consumer feedback rolling in. In this time as we continue to develop our existing
				service, we will look into hiring new additions to the team to aid us. This will be especially crucial
				as we plan to extend our services into other games. The main roles we would be looking to add to our
				team are as follows. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="leftcolumn">
				<h2>Project Manager</h2>
				<p>Our project manager will manage communication between team members, ensuring that
					everyone is on the same page. This position will involve direct communication with
					employees as they will organise workflow between staff members, coordinate meetings,
					and maintain a comfortable work environment. Experience with leadership and management
					techniques will be needed for this position, as you’ll be taking the head of meetings,
					and ensuring that everyone completes their work by the specified deadline.</p>
				<h2>Junior Game Programmer</h2>
				<p>Our junior game programmer will work in direct support of the Brogrammer. Their role
					will be to write and implement graphical and functional elements of code into the app.
					The ability to be self-motivated and have strong technical problem-solving skills will be
					essential to be able to interact with the already established team. As the development of
					the app uses C# & C++ languages, are proficiency in these areas will be essential.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="rightcolumn">
				<h2>Security Engineer</h2>
				<p>The safety of our consumers’ data is one of our top priorities in Ex Machina. As a Chief
					Security Engineer, you’ll be in charge of implementing security solutions within our products
					as you conduct risk assessments and identify/eliminate vulnerabilities in our app. If you have
					experience with a variety of security products such as firewalls and virus protection, and are
					ready to work in a fast-paced business environment, this is the job for you.</p>
				<h2>Creative Director</h2>
				<p>This is a key position in bringing this project to life, as you'll be the deciding factor in
					everything from colour palettes to font choice. If you think that image should be shifted a few
					pixels to the right, then it’s your call to make! You’ll be responsible in setting an appropriate
					aesthetic to match our vision, ensuring that a high-quality product is produced, that is accessible
					for all audiences. We’re looking for someone who’s proficient in creative design to elevate our
					brand;
					bonus points if you’ve got experience with the Adobe Creative Suite.</p>
