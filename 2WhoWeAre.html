			<h1>Personal Profiles</h1>
				<h2>Team Name: Ex Machina</h2>
				<h2>Team Profiles</h2>
					<h3>16 Personalities Results</h3>
						<t>Regarding the MBTI profiles, as a team, we have a good combination of consulting and feeling types balanced by some opinionated, campaigner and debater types.</t>
							<br>
							<br>
						<t>With half of the group falling into the (X)NFP category, they are more suited to interpersonal relationships and being in tune with everyone's feelings. In comparison, the rest of us with thinking and judging types are more suited to forging the path and motivating the team.</t>
					<h3>Learning Styles Results</h3>
						<t>Our learning styles are also complimentary; all 6 of us have the 'Pragmatist' approach as one of the highest scores we received. Being a pragmatic leaning group, we will thrive on group discussions and brainstorming.</t>
					<h3>Big 5 Results</h3>
						<t>Our big 5 test results are varied and cover all the bases once again. Everyone scored above average or average in at least one category, and we have members excelling in different traits. With this information we can use it as an aid when thinking of assigning tasks; we can first assess each other's strengths and weaknesses.</t>
				<h2>Personality Profiles</h2>

						<h3>Kayla</h3>
							<t>My test results are a good indicator of my strengths, weaknesses, and my priorities. The MBTI results declare that I am driven by curiosity and ask plenty of questions. While I do not agree with everything it claimed, the MBTI type I was given has given me the opportunity to self-reflect on my thoughts and ideals. What I can take from the learning styles results, is that hopefully, I am equally engaged with all kinds of learning styles. My Big 5 results are quite obviously weighted towards two categories, those being Conscientiousness and Intellect/Imagination. I can see why I got such low scores in the other categories and would agree that they are mostly accurate. Looking at the rest of my group, I think my deficits are evenly balanced out, and vice versa.</t>
						<h3>Chris</h3>
							<t>My Personality profile as indicated by the Myer-Briggs test had put me in the category of INFJ-T.  This is what is labelled as a Turbulent advocate. The strengths of my personality type are feeling the need to stand up for what is right, along with being creative and insightful. Weaknesses of this personality type is that I can be sensitive to criticism and be a perfectionist. Some of the traits associated with this personality can be beneficial in a team environment, with always looking to help and inspire others. Through the DISC test I completed it showed a high score of Dominance as a personality trait. This could be interpreted showing strength in decision making.</t>
						<h3>Nadette</h3>
							<t>These results indicate that Iâ€™m an introverted, quiet individual, but care deeply for those around me. In a team environment, I want to ensure that everyone is always on the same page, and wish for everyone to be heard, and I will always try to resolve conflict in a non-confrontational way. While I encourage other people to be heard, I scarcely speak my own mind as I often doubt myself. I seek constant validation and feedback from my peers, wishing to evolve and improve on myself, making myself generally quite flexible and open to new concepts and ideas as I tend to think hard on them.</t>

						<h3>Rich</h3>
							<t>After reviewing my results across the 3 different tests, I see the qualities highlighted to be an accurate representation of my personality. Interestingly, the results of this Myer-Briggs test differed from when I first did this upon joining the Navy (in Recruit School). This could be attributed to both the high levels of personal growth and practical knowledge the navy has provided me. Moreover, based on my experience, and as highlighted in the results, I have an extremely agreeable, practical and dependable personality which allows me to be a valuable team member. Hence, I am comfortable with a more authoritative role in the team or a more supportive one. To me, a great team is one which has strong communication, support and are goal focused, thus when forming a team, my adaptability allows me to gel with various personalities and contribute to different roles.</t>
						<h3>Brandon</h3>
							<t>The results of these tests show how I am laid back and quite easy but also like to sit in the shadows and talk or do when it is necessary and that I also like to go with the flow and am happy to do whatever it is that the team decides to do, and when they decide what to do I knuckle down and make sure I get done what is needed to be done. I think it will affect my role in the team as an extra pair of hands because I won't be fussed about the main decisions of the team and agree with the others but I will surely put in the work so make sure we succeed.</t>
						<h3>Paul</h3>
							<t>My test results from the Myers Briggs personality placed me as a Campaigner type with ENFP personality type. Some of the strengths that I associate with that are detailed in this personality profile are observant, excellent communicators and know how to relax. Some of the weaknesses are overthinking things to the point where at times it is difficult to start a project or task from overthinking or planning. I feel these points work well within this team environment and the only real weakness that I have identified is well balanced with some of the others in the group and vice versa with the strengths.</t>
