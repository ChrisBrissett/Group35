				<p>For assignment 2, I was a member of Ex Machina, and I’m really looking forward to working with the group again for 
				Assignment 3 and 5. I believe that we worked extremely well together, always meeting deadlines, and putting in effort 
				towards completing the project. Unfortunately, one of our members was lacking the same drive as the rest of us, but we 
				were able to pick up the slack.</p>

				<p>Working with Ex Machina in assignment 2, I think we all had specific goals for what we wanted to do and were very good 
				at identifying and working to everyone’s strengths. Unfortunately, one of our previous members lacked motivation and initiative 
				despite our attempts to include them; they regrettably can’t join us for the next project. Going into our next project I believe
				our stricter approach to meetings and tasks will help to clear up expectations of all members, and the group.  </p>

				<p>During assignment 2, our group was very active and worked quite well together. Unfortunately, we had one member that did not 
				lift his weight, so moving forward we have one less member. Our communication was effective and focused. Microsoft Teams was a 
				little frustrating, and we used Discord for most of our communication and catchups as it was a common tool used by all members.</p>
