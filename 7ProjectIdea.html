		<h1>Project Description</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p> After receiving feedback from Assignment 2, our group is determined to start
				work on what is remarked as being a unique and easily expandable idea.
				Through deep planning and market research, we have begun the build of
				a new app, an app that will mitigate lack of score sheets across a range of
				board games. Our first target is for the game Cluedo. Our team are working
				hard towards delivering a fully functional app that takes away the need for
				physical score cards. This app is driven to keep the game rolling, without
				taking away the social dynamic of playing a board game with your friends or
				family.</p>
			<p>As you can appreciate, there are thousands upon thousands of board games
				available. With our project open ended, we plan to add new games as they
				are released and continue to digitise the classic board game experience.</p>
			<p>Not only is this project viable in the real-world market, it also follows the
				current IT trend of cloud computing (2021 IT (Information Technology)
				Industry Trends Analysis | Business of Technology | CompTIA 2020) a and
				provides our members valuable experience and opportunity to develop key
				skills needed for our ideal careers. Cloud computing for example is a key skill
				required for both Paul and Kayla, as System Engineer, and Cyber Security
				engineer as their respective career choices. This project also gives Rich
				an opportunity to show experience managerial qualities, and Bernadette
				will be able to develop marketing strategies and develop a portfolio. As a
				prospective game programmer, Chris will find many opportunities to develop his coding and software
				knowledge.</p>

		<h2>Topic</h2>
		<p>Our project idea is to develop and implement an app for use on the Google
			Play Store and Apple App Store, which would replace the score sheets and
			clue cards when playing the board game Cluedo. The game will be able to
			keep track of each game you play, making it a more effective method of
			being able to keep track of what cards you were dealt along with being able
			to make off options you have ruled out in the current game.</p>
		<p>The ideal outcome for the app would be to have a functional replacement
			for Cluedo score cards and clue-keeping sheets initially. We will then look at
			developing further functions such as random card shuffling and distribution
			amongst players, as well as storing the case file cards.</p>
			
		<h2>Motvation</h2>
		<p>The motivation behind this idea is that many people worldwide who still
			enjoy the social experience of playing board games with family and friends,
			is that they find that pieces of the game constantly go missing. The biggest
			issue specifically for the game of Cluedo is having to re-print pages upon
			pages of scoresheets to replace the sheets already consumed. Nowadays,
			board games have been uploaded to the internet allowing a much larger
			opportunity of players, trying to combine the useability of mobile phones
			and the social togetherness of playing board games is the driving motivation
			behind the idea. By doing this and creating the app, we are looking at
			following trends of having a companion app for board games to incorporate
			the use of mobile phones. Many game titles played on PC or console have a
			companion app used to track transfer and monitor game progress. What we
			aim to do is provide a similar service to a different demographic of users.</p>
		
		<h2>Landscape</h2>
		<p>While researching the current environment for boardgame apps and other
			score keeping apps. There seems to only be a select few apps of quality
			and popularity. In regards to Clue/do specific apps there is one that I could
			find, ‘Clue Solver - for Clue or Cluedo board games’, from publisher Brady
			Anderson on the app store. Released in 2012, the only reviews seem to be
			negative stating the app was buggy or freezes often. With no updates in
			last 8 years I would say it is not much in the way of competition. The only
			other app I found similar to our own and with any sort of popularity is a
			game score keeping app called ‘ScorePal’ published by HappyFaceDevs on
			the Google Play store. The last update to this game was in 2018; it also has
			positive and recent reviews by users. Our advantage over this app would
			be our in-game mechanic support (such as card management and clue
			keeping).</p>
		<p>After investigating the current landscape, we have devised a new goal, which
			is to provide regular and consistent updates. Doing this should provide ample
			incentive to new users, compared to the competition and the lack of recent
			developments. With the current environment reasonably untouched, should
			we release this app we believe there would be little to no competition.</p>

		<h1>Detailed Description</h1>
		<h2>Aims</h2>
		<p>Our primary goal is to deliver a high quality, user friendly app to board gamers
			around the world. The app will be accessible across multiple platforms, 
			it will be simple to use and have a strong focus on retaining the social
			dynamics of playing a board game with friends and family.</p>
		<p>As we progress through development of our app, we have set milestones and
			smaller goals that we aim for. This allows us to stay focused on making sure
			that we develop a fully functional application that is accessible for all ages.</p>
			
			<h3>Key Focus Points</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>A warm and welcoming interface, encouraging useres to interact through
						the boardgame</li>
					<li>Multi-device functionality</li>
					<li>Multi-game compatability</li>
					<li>Achieving a fully operational application by the due date</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Our team’s priority is to develop an app that assists Cluedo players mitigate
					the issues attaining to paper score cards.</p>
				<p>Throughout the process of developing the app, we will have many versions,
					both major and minor updates included. For major updates, we have planned
					for our version 1.0 to have a working login screen which connects with the
					AWS servers to store and retrieve user data. In this version we also plan to
					have the clue-keeping card fully functional, as it’s the most important feature
					at this stage in our project. In Version 2.0 we will move onto incorporating
					the Cards and the graphical elements associated to these to provide a much
					more detailed GUI experience. This release will have the cards stored on
					the app, along with using AWS’ GameLift to power the random allocation of
					the cards. Our Version 3.0 will have all the listed features above as well as
					the ability for users to send information to other players, for example the
					showing of the card based on a player guess.</p>
				<p>Once we have all these features and versions in place, the app will have the
					base code and design, along with the connectivity with AWS’ services to
					implement various versions of the game Cluedo [1] and other board game
					titles.</p>
			<h3>Interface</h3>
				<p>We aim to have an interface that opens correctly firstly developed for
					Android. The interface needs to be user friendly and provide users with
					intuitive functionality. All the main page buttons need to interact correctly
					and be in line with what users expectations. The user should be able to
					sign in with there chosen method be it via google or social media sign in or
					alternatively create an individual account not linked to the aforementioned
					socials. When the user signs in the app should have the functionality to
					recall the individuals game history including resuming play as well as the
					users saved preferences. One of the most important aspects that we
					will endeavour to focus on is the look and the feel of the app from the
					beginning sign on page. The most critical measure of success for us in
					the implementation of the app and its interface, is that we give the user a
					seamless GUI which easily transitions based on the request of the user.</p>
				<p>We need the app to be able to react in real time with AWS servers, sending
					and retrieving data to other users. The most critical measure of success for
					us in the implementation of the app and its interface, is that we give the user
					a seamless GUI which easily transitions based on the request of the user. We
					need the app to be able to react in real time with AWS servers, sending and
					retrieving data to other users.</p>
			<h3>Multi-Functionality</h3>
				<p>We are aiming to develop the app initially for Android users as this is where
					our team’s current skill set sits to be able to produce the required code. 
					As Java is used in the Android Studio SDK Manager [2] we can easily
					implement the base framework for the app. Once we have done this, we can
					use Xaramin [3] to translate the code for release to iOS devices. When the
					app is developed and meets this functionality the future releases and code
					development will become easier to update of the two App stores.</p>
			<h3>Multi-Game Capability</h3>
				<p>When our app is developed and functioning correctly, we will explore adding
					options to customise the layout of the scorecard making it applicable to
					other similar boardgames. Eventually with user feedback we will have
					different pre-loaded templates for specific games. Through the review of
					this feedback, we can implement additional features, along with taking
					suggestions from users on other board games that could benefit from this
					type of application. We have designed the app to not be just one dimensional
					for the game Cluedo, as we look to expand and not limit ourselves to a niche
					demographic of users.</p>

		<h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
			<h3>Where We Are Now</h3>
			<p>The app began as an idea to replace paper scoresheets and cards. The
				motivation to get this idea up and running was the constant battle of trying to
				hide your scoresheet from other players, with giant cubby houses of boxing.
				The idea was initially to get a functional app for use on mobile devices that
				could supplement the aforementioned. Using the accessibility of mobile
				devices, we looked at a basic functional app that could achieve this.</p>
			<p>The story for our project begins prior to Week 1, with Chris having the idea to
				create a digital companion app for board games. Chris developed the start of
				this idea in his first assignment, then when we all came together as a group
				for assignment 2, as Ex Machina, we took it upon ourselves to bring it to life.</p>
			<p>We began our project with a total of six members in Week 1, however, we
				concluded there was an imbalance in the contributions amongst team
				members. While conflict-resolution was attempted with the specific team
				member in question, we were unable to come to a satisfactory conclusion,
				and we had to exclude them from the group going forward. Unfortunately,
				this change in our roster shifted our initial timeline for the product
				substantially, as the work of six people had to be split upon five. While we are
				still picking up the pieces, we are back on track with our projected progress
				thus far, despite losing a member. This has only gone to prove how persistent 
				we are as a team, and how well we work together as a singular unit.</p>
			<p>During the first few weeks of any project, a time to plan and prepare is
				essential. Week 1 for our team was about developing a very basic plan, with
				pencilled designs and concepts to help brainstorm how we were to approach
				the project ahead.</p>
			<p>In the second week, we had achieved some clear plans on the direction that
				we wanted to take to develop a functioning app at the end of the project. It
				allowed each department to further plan in their fields retrospectively and
				prepare for the pre-design and build phases. When our project idea was
				first conceived, we had the idea of having multiple board games within the
				application, however, this proved to be too ambitious for the time period
				and resources at our disposal. We came together early on during the project
				and decided to tone down the scope of our project, instead, creating an
				application to support a singular board game instead of multiple. This game
				that we decided on was Cluedo, and there was a clear resonance in the group
				as we came to an agreement. It is the perfect canvas and example for our
				idea, and we’d love to branch into other games eventually. With our focus
				changed, we proceeded into week 3.</p>
		<h3>How It Has Progressed</h3>
			<p>Going into week 3, and Assignment 3, we started to really delve into the
				details and nuance of our project, both the front and back end. As our team
				progressed through the first few weeks, we were able to better grasp goals
				and targets that we wanted to achieve. Our brainstorming period allowed us
				to focus on the company’s focus and what we wanted to have in front of our
				clients at the end of the 16-week project.</p>
			<p>In this time, we encountered another complication during the development
				phase of our project. Initially, we were torn between creating an Android exclusive 
				app, and one that would support cross-platform – the choice of
				development studio was dependent on this decision. Eventually, we settled
				on Xaramin, as we would be able to produce a product that was compatible
				with both Android and iOS. This is because one of our most important
				values that guide us is inclusivity; we want everyone to be able to use this
				application with their loved ones, regardless of application. While there was
				a brief learning curve for the software, the developers quickly got their heads
				around it.</p>
		<h3>Where We Are Now</h3>
			<p>We are now approaching the 9th week of our project, which means we are
				well on the way to a fully functional app.</p>
			<p>We feel sure that we are on track to deliver a fully functional product. We
				have a plan, and each member of our team is focused on their tasks. We
				are up to week 9 of our 16 week plan and have the app framework coming
				together.</p>
			<p>Most of the creative assets have been created for the application, our
				funding pitch, as well as our social media branding. Further planning for
				marketing is to be done within this next week, as we explore further into the
				interests of our audience.</p>
			<p>As we review our progress up to and including the current weeks plan, we
				have established a functional user interface and clue-keeping sheet in the
				Alpha stage which the user can interact with. As we progress further into the
				project, we aim to incorporate a more cohesive User Interface before launch.</p>
			<p>After completing several rounds of internal testing for key UX and QA
				metrics such as application response time and app crashes, we will soon
				be releasing a version Alpha to a closed group of users to test further. Week
				9 is here, and our development team has worked hard to achieve a working
				platform that is approaching inhouse testing. Our next major hurdle is
				achieving the right look and feel with the user interface before we release the
				app for inhouse testing.</p>
			<p>After about 6 weeks of hard work and dedication, our team have arrived at
				our goals and are on track for the remainder of our project term. Up and
				coming is the remainder of the build, with our team working hard on the
				applications functionality. We have begun reaching out for our alpha testers
				for the closed environment testing phase which is due in roughly 4 weeks'
				time. This testing phase is essential to the success of our application.</p>
			<p>With our hearts set on having this app multi-functional across a plethora of
				games, our current project is being built with open ended code, allowing us
				to copy the features to other games in the future. Our Product Manager is
				working closely with some big-name brands on introducing their game to the
				app soon. These are exciting times!</p>
	<h2>Roles</h2>
		<p>We as Ex Machina, have decided that we will be defining roles for each of
			our members. This is because we all have very specific skills that we already
			excel at and have skills that we’d like to improve upon. In addition, we believe
			that dedicated roles in this project will help to give a clear and concise
			direction for each member to focus on.</p>
	<div class="row">
			<div class="leftcolumn">
		<h3>Social Sensei (Product Manager) - <i>Rich</i></h3>
			<p>A product manager’s role is to focus on the planning and execution of the
				overall product being delivered. From the start of conceptualisation, to the
				finished product, this role covers all areas to confirm that the product will be
				delivered in a timely and cost-effective manner. The highest priority for this
				role is to keep the product on track and aligned with the company’s goals and
				morals.</p>
		<h3>Brogrammer (Game Designer) - <i>Chris</i></h3>
			<p>You’ll be working with your fellow team members to design the core aspects
				of the game and be a key member in bringing our vision to life. This position
				will involve working closely with our creative and software team as you
				design the core aspects of the game, and they implement your ideas into
				reality. You’ll be taking care of the logistical side of things, designing the
				graphics, animations and layout for our app. You need to be an innovative
				thinker, and quick to adapt to new situations.</p>
		<h3>Technical Evangelist (Software Technical Lead) - <i>Paul</i></h3>
			<p>The technical lead role is crucial in developing a successful product and
				comprises of bringing together and overseeing the team of technical
				personnel. As with any lead position one of the most challenging part of
				developing is the co-ordination of different creative aspects. Specifically
				focusing on the development our application from a software and creative
				perspective gives rise to a lot of challenging problems that can call for some
				creative solutions.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="rightcolumn">
		<h3>Director of First Impressions (QA & UX Manager) - <i>Kayla</i></h3>
			<p>The application we’re developing is ultimately to serve the user and their
				goals. Therefore, the user experience is our top priority. In order to achieve
				what we would consider the optimal user experience, one of the most
				important things is a bug-free application. This is where quality assurance
				and testing come into play. As QA & UX Manager I will ensure throughout
				every stage, our app is being tested for the best quality and experience. This
				also means organising testing groups and any alphas, betas, etc.</p>
		<h3>Comic Sans Annihilator (Media Coordinator) - <i>Bernadette</i></h3>
			<p>As Media Coordinator, you’ll take full control of the creation and content
				posted to Ex Machina’s social media accounts, along with the creation of a
				brand package that can be used by any other content creators or businesses.
				If you’re someone who has experience with copywriting, an eye for graphic
				design, and are interested in taking the helm of an entire brand/application,
				this is the position for you. You’ll interact closely with the Creative Team to
				digitally grow our brand by identifying our audience and creating content
				to appeal to them. You’ll also be assisting the creative team with creating
				assets for our product.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	<h2>Scopes and Limits</h2>
		<p>As we review the overall scope of the project, we understand we will have
			certain limitations to what we can implement within the initial project period
			up to week 6. As we are looking to develop an application which not only
			serves the basic functionality of replacing a scorecard in Cluedo, which
			would be our initial release of version 1. In v1, we aim to be able to provide
			an experience much more immersive which will incorporate card sharing
			amongst various other features. As we progress and add additional features
			to the app, we aim to be able to develop the app in a way which allows
			incorporation of numerous versions of not only the game Cluedo, but with
			the intention of being able to deploy for other board games, some of which
			may be considered Retro; our goal is to revitalise the experience of these
			games. As we progress through these steps will be able to show potential
			stakeholders how our app has a market value for a moderate demographic
			of users.</p>
		<p>Initially we will not be able to release a full version of our desired
			app. We considered using Monaca[1] as our initial development tool,
			however, after much consideration and review we decided to use
			Xaramin[2] and the Android SDK studio[3]. As we chose this path to
			begin our venture, our app will be released first to the Google Play
			Store[4] leaving an opportunity for the future development for the Apple
			Store[5]. Although we aim to initially release to Android devices, this
			provides us with the opportunity to show the usefulness of our app.</p>
	<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
		<h3>Code/App Development</h3>
			<p>After review of feedback given and extensive research into finding a suitable
				cross platform developer, we have decided to use Microsoft’s Visual Studio
				version 16.8.1, Android.Sdk.Manager version 4.1.1 & Xamarin version 4.8.0
				[1]. With this we will be provided with a single, cross platform API (Application
				Programming Interface) to develop code to be used across iOS and Android
				[2] using C# as the language.</p>
			<p>Xaramin extends .NET with tools and libraries designed specifically for
				building apps on iOS & Android. Microsoft’s Visual Studio and Xaramin are
				free and require no licensing costs. We will use these development tools
				along with GitHub to opensource and code we may require.</p>
			<p>To use this we will need access to a Desktop computer or laptop with access
				to the internet. As the developer tools we will be using can be used on either
				Windows or macOS there will be no requirement to use a dedicated operating
				system.</p>
		<h3>Storage/Connectivity</h3>
			<p>To store user information and records we will use Amazon Web Services
				(AWS) Mobile app Backend [3] to access Amazon Cognito User Pools. This
				will allow users of the app to sign up and sign in to the application. Here is a
				diagram from Amazon depicting their cloud database structure.</p>
			<p>We will use AWS GameLift to manage the servers and allow interconnectivity
				of the game. As our app requires interaction between multiple devices in
				real-time, this is a core component to ensuring the viability of the product.
				We aim to achieve this by using the Amazon GameLift SDK Version 4.0.2 [4].
				Below is a basic database diagram from AWS GameLift.</p>
			<p>As we are using a cloud-based solution to store and connect users we
				do not need any physical hardware to achieve this. We have, however,
				considered that we will need our own database to store on AWS we
				designed a very basic data structure of our own. This covers our most
				necessary information such as user IDs, game IDs, account data, and
				history.</p>
	<h2>Testing</h2>
		<p>Our app will go through continuous testing throughout the design and build
			process. During the build, the app will be debugged and trialled as if it was
			available on the app store. Our commitment to developing a functional and
			engaging app needs to be closely reviewed to confirm that we are on the
			right track. We will be focusing on accessibility, future game compatibility
			and overall design. We’ll put our app through testing phases: Alpha and
			Beta. The Alpha phase will be closed off to friends and family and will ideally
			include users both with and without Cluedo experience, as well as a variety
			of ages and confidence levels with technology. Doing this we ensure a varied
			testing pool, and a more inclusive and accessible end product. During testing
			we have developed our own metrics in addition to taking suggestion from
			Todd DeCapua, the Executive of JP Morgan who states that “-it is important
			to gather both front-end and back-end metrics. Client-side measures are vital to
			understanding the front-end user experience.” (DeCapua 2015).</p>
		<p>To this end, we have this list of metrics to test for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Application response time</li>
				<li>App crashes</li>
				<li>Data retrieval and storing accuracy</li>
			</ul>
		<p>In-app deduction logic accuracy After our closed Alpha, we’ll be pushing the
			app into an open Beta, where anyone who has been following our development will 
			be able to download and test it, providing feedback accordingly. When fully released, 
			our feedback will be gained through the number of individual downloads, along with 
			app reviews after people appreciate the uniqueness of the app.</p>
	<h2>Risks</h2>
		<p>In any project large or small, there will always be risks associated. Many of
			these risks are avoidable if a plan is made and these risks identified early on,
			often recognised during a risk assessment with a risk/hazard matrix suitable
			for the tasks.</p>
		<p>Thorough research on tools used in our project will alleviate or significantly
			reduce risk that could lead to project down time, or late delivery. As our
			project is completed online through collaboration tools such as Microsoft
			Teams and Discord, we rest easy knowing that the data that we store and
			enter here is secure and backed up to the cloud consistently. These cloud
			services are mirrored around the globe, allowing for true redundancy, and
			ability to work anywhere at any time, even without an internet connection.</p>
		<p>As our team is quite young, we are continually developing our teamwork and
			collaboration skills. We acknowledge that there may be limitations with our
			reach or the knowledge that we have within the ICT world, but as a team, our
			wingspan is great. With our 5 members working in very different fields, we
			are confident with our ability to research tools, and identify what is best for
			our group and the project at hand.</p>
		<p>Some of the consequences that are associated with development of a
			mobile application are changes to the schedule, unfinished tasks that are
			assigned to team members, overloading or underloading team members and
			total re-writes of the app. To mitigate the abovementioned risks, our team
			will analyse what kind of impact this may have on the team or the project
			itself. It will allow us as a team to develop strategies to avoid the chance of
			catastrophe.</p>
		<p>One risk that our group aim to avoid for this project is unplanned absences
			of team members. This leads to delays in completion of individual and group
			tasks, demotivation, disorganisation and gaps in knowledge when other team
			members try to pick up the slack. Our team have committed their time to
			delivering a solid project for assignment 3 and look forward to seeing it grow
			from what it is today.</p>
	<h2>Group Processes and Communications</h2>
		<p>Based on our group and individual reflections from Assignment 2, we have
			made a few adjustments to our meeting schedule and agendas.</p>
		<p>We have elected to meet formally once a week on Tuesday evenings for
			anywhere from 45mins to an hour, more if everyone is comfortable and
			we’re making good progress. We do this using Microsoft Teams meetings
			from there we can share our screens and review our report together. We also
			have informal catch ups which can last 10-20 minutes on any day we deem
			its needed, often before a due date, or when members are stuck on what to
			do next. Frequent text-based communication throughout the week is also
			encouraged through either discord or Microsoft Teams. If we are unable to
			contact a team member through Discord or Microsoft Teams, we will send
			an email to their school address and inform our tutor. Important notes from
			a meeting or other development they may have missed, will be kept and
			passed on to them as soon as possible.</p>
