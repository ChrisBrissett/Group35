		<h1>PROJECT IDEA: Boardgame Score App</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p> The project we have decided as a team to undertake and implement is to design a mobile application available
			on the Google Play and Apple App stores, which would replace the score sheets and cards when playing
			the board game Cluedo. The app will be downloadable to keep track of each game you play, joining
			together in a game lobby, making it a more effective method of being able to keep track of what cards you
			are dealt along with being able to mark off options you have ruled out in the current game.
		</p>
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p>The motivation behind this idea is that many people worldwide who still enjoy the social experience of
			playing board games with family and friends, is that they find that pieces of the game constantly go
			missing. The biggest issue specifically for the game of Cluedo is having to re-print pages upon pages of
			scoresheets to replace the sheets already consumed. Nowadays, board games have been uploaded to the internet
			allowing a much larger opportunity of players, trying to combine the useability of mobile phones and the
			social togetherness of playing board games is the driving motivation behind the idea.</p>

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<figure>
			<img class=resize src="FIGURE1.png" alt="App UI Mock up figure 1">
			<figcaption>[Fig 1]</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>The application would be designed to require people to log-on to their relevant app store and download the
			app. Upon opening the app, players will be asked to create an account [Fig 1]. With the registration,
			players will be able to look up player-based statistics such as games won/lost and who they commonly play
			against, giving an extra element of bragging rights within the family or group of friends. Once registration
			is completed the players will be able to create a lobby, which will allow additional players to join a
			session and will assign them a player number and player home screen. The person who creates the game lobby
			will be allocated as the game host. The app will have the functionality to pre-allocate cards that the
			players are required to guess to win the game.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="FIGURE2.png" alt="App UI Mock up figure 2">
			<figcaption>[Fig 2]</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>Once this is done the game host will execute a function on the app which will shuffle and deal the remaining
			cards to the number of players in the game, as it would happen in any standard game of Cluedo [3]. The app
			will also show images of each card on the screen [Fig 2], which are personal to each player. What this will
			allow is that each player using their own phone will be able to minimize and refer to the cards they have
			been allocated at any time. This would also be relevant when showing a player a card of yours. After a guess
			is made, the player required to show the card will be able to do so in show mode, which sends a copy of the
			card that was guessed to the player to the opposing player, where they will be able to view the card for 3
			seconds and mark it off on their scoresheet.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="FIGURE3.png" alt="App UI Mock up figure 3">
			<figcaption>[Fig 3]</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p> The scoresheet will allow the user to check boxes of cards that they have but also cards that have been
			sighted by other players. There will also be a shading system for the scoresheet as well, which will allow
			you to mark off guesses being made by other players [Fig 3]. For anyone who has ever played Cluedo [3]
			before would know the benefits of being able to reach a conclusion based on what is being guessed by others.
			The benefits of using the app especially for this part of the game will remove the ‘cubby house’ boxes that
			players build to avoid having the prying eyes of others scan over their scoresheet whilst they are marking
			off and formulating guesses.
			As mentioned previously, there are already electronic versions of this game available on various platforms,
			with the app and its design the group of people playing will be able to choose what level of interaction
			with the game would be required from the app. So, choosing whether to only use the scoresheet or using the
			cards as well, will be dependent on player preference. The app is not designed to take over the interaction
			in place between people playing but to allow a more streamline experience and decrease the chances of a
			table being flipped over in the living room.

		<h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
		<p>The two fundamental requirements to make this app successful are, the use of a cloud storage system to
			securely store the information provided by the players and enabling them to join a game lobby, along with
			and IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to create the app for use on multiple platforms.
			Cloud storage – Amazon Web Services (AWS) [4]. To be able to store user information, provide statistics and
			allow the players to connect, we would need to have relevant storage. The most effective way to do this
			would be using a cloud-based storage and management service. Our solution to this problem is utilizing AWS’
			Mobile Backend Services. This service would allow us to easily deploy backend game services to create
			identity management for players, along with being able to track player statistics and leaderboards with the
			use of the database services they have [4].
			Now that we have the backend of our application, we need to consider how we would develop the interactive
			part of the experience.
			IDE – Monaca Cloud for IDE [5] – This tool would be used to develop the application for use on multiple
			platforms. Monaca is a cloud-based development environment that is often used to create applications. Using
			HTML5/CSS and JavaScript, we will be able to begin an online build of the application, and use the database
			tools they have, to create the database in which we would hold the information and data of each of our users
			that we would merge the structure over to our AWS Databases. Monaca will allow us to create the raw code for
			the development, then allow us to test and finish the online build before publishing to the online app
			stores [5].
		</p>
		<h2>Skills Required</h2>
		<p>To be able to write and develop the proposed app we would need to have the skill in the above app development
			tool. As the tool uses HTML5/CSS and JavaScript we would need to understand the hard coding required for the
			back end of the development. As for AWS where our app will be stored and operate from, there are many
			tutorials online that we can use to familiarize ourselves with the process of creating and maintaining the
			cloud network. To collaborate on this project, we will be using a version-controlled collaboration tool. To
			make the most out of this, we would also need to have appropriate skills in teamwork/collaboration,
			communication, and version control. These skills are also relevant to ideal jobs portrayed by most, if not
			all members in the team.
		</p>
		<h2>Outcome</h2>
		<p>
			Overall, we believe this project to be one that could be quite achievable. If we were to successfully
			develop the app the core issue that the app is designed to alleviate will be achieved. This would remove the
			paper scoresheet requirement from the game. Whilst the app is giving users access to a digital version of
			the scoresheet and cards, it will not remove the social interaction surrounding playing the game. This will
			solve the original problem of running out the paper scoresheets, as well as any lost or misplaced pieces of
			the game.
			The positive outcomes of the project are not limited to the above. The idea behind the app is to get a
			mobile application for use with a single board game straight to market to show how the social interaction of
			board games, and useability of mobile phones can be used cohesively. Once we have established the app, we
			can look at incorporating it with other games such as Risk and Monopoly [6].
