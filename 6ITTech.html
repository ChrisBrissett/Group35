		<h1>BLOCK CHAIN</h1>
		<h2><i>What does it do?</i></h2>
		<p>Blockchain is the technology which makes cryptocurrencies available to us. The most popular and well known
			cryptocurrency is Bitcoin.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Blockchain consists of a chain of blocks, where each block holds a record of transactions which includes a
			header that holds information such as the version of the block, a timestamp and also holds a hash that
			contains identification details of the previous block. The body in the block holds other information
			including a transaction counter. This counter holds the total number of transactions in that block and the
			details of the past transactions within that block. Each block can have a different size in data used based
			on the amount of the transaction and other variables within the data of the block.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Blockchains are not owned by a particular company or person (quite unlike any other currency that is managed
			by various banks and governments) as it is hosted on range of computers via a network. The blockchain can be
			accessed by anyone unless the blockchain is private. If the blockchain is private it can only be accessed by
			the people with authority to access it whereas anybody who tries to maliciously change the data of the block
			or for their own benefit would be rejected and ignored by the network.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Cryptocurrencies are a form of decentralized currency made up of data, and like any currency, it can be used
			to purchase goods and services. Transactions made via Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin remain completely
			anonymous, which is why it is the most used currency on the dark web and other illegal services.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Although the currency system is anonymous and untraceable, it is still used for surface web transactions
			where privacy is of the essence.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Even with the extra layers of security within blockchain technology, it is still not 100% secure. It is
			extremely difficult to breach, which mitigates risk of the common thief. Many of the world’s currencies are
			regulated by government bodies and some countries will even isolate their specific currency meaning that it
			is only useable in their country. Bitcoin is globally accessible, which can allow users to avoid pricey
			exchange rates.</p>
		<br>
		<p>As we progress into the 21st century, more businesses are accepting crypto as a form of payment, with the
			most common being Bitcoin. This gives reason to believe that the value of crypto will continue to increase
			and become more readily available for day to day transactions. It’s already slowly happening where there are
			visa cards which allow users to have their preferred cryptocurrency in their wallet and will be converted
			into their local currency for payments over their VISA card.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The success of a particular cryptocurrency is determined by its daily trade volume, meaning the more people
			that use that cryptocurrency can affect its value and how well its doing. The success of Bitcoin could lead
			us towards a globally cashless society. With more people using mobile phones and smart watches for payment
			methods such as PayWave and Pay Pass, we could soon find ourselves using Bitcoin as a primary currency.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The use of cryptocurrency is peer to peer based which means there is no middleman such as a bank or finance
			companies. Each peer to peer transaction is cryptographically verified with the blockchain technology. For a
			transaction to be completed, underlying networked computers solve mathematical algorithms which verify the
			specific transaction. The user of the networked computer that is solving these problems is paid a small
			amount of crypto as a reward, commonly referred to as ‘Mining’. Although there are fees when using Bitcoin,
			they are significantly lower than fees of other companies such as PayPal and other banks that incur fees on
			specific types of accounts and transactions such as overseas transactions.</p>
		<br>
		<h2><i>What is the likely impact?</i></h2>
		<p>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies will impact the world in various ways. The first notable impact will be the
			change from physical currency to digital currency as noted before. This could mean that those without
			internet access will suffer significantly, which could portray a financial burden for those that cannot
			afford it. Though this could be beneficial to see a growth in the world's internet capability. This impact
			could see greater focus on security regarding the exchange of crypto as every transaction must be
			authenticated/verified without the ability to be manipulated.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The second notable impact will see growth in competition of the global crypto market. Companies will be
			fighting for transactions and trade volume to become more valuable.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The third notable impact would see big banks becoming less relevant as they won't be used as frequently when
			crypto becomes the primary method of transaction. Unfortunately, this would lead to job redundancies as the
			banks would slowly dissipate. </p>
		<br>
		<p>The fourth notable impact would be the larger range of anonymity when making transactions using crypto as it
			is very difficult to trace and would give the users a great deal of privacy that they did not have when
			using your eftpos and debit card transactions where everything is managed and usually reviewed by the banks
			for suspicious activity.</p>
		<br>
		<h2><i>How will this affect me?</i></h2>
		<p>Personal impacts would see changes in the way we use and spend money. Setting up a computer to mine
			algorithms will allow for some additional income will be seen more often in households. By not carrying
			physical currency it would lower the risk of being mugged, but it could also increase the rate of kidnapping
			and forcing the victim to transfer funds to random accounts. Because of how anonymous crypto transactions
			are being almost untraceable, it could make it extremely difficult for police to follow up and pin the
			perpetrator. </p>
		<br>
		<p>As it is not managed by the big banks who manage their transactions and have control over the money in your
			account and are also insured in the case of a physical and/or cyber robbery, if my bitcoin wallet was
			compromised and hacked, I would not be able to make a claim to my bank saying that this transaction was
			fraudulent and I would lose my crypto. But in saying this if crypto became as big as we predict, crypto
			insurance companies would probably pop up all over the globe. </p>
		<br>
		<p>This could also affect me in the job industry as rates on unemployment would go up and more people would be
			looking for jobs as all bank and other jobs needed in a world of physical currency such as jobs at the Mint,
			would no longer be needed.</p>

		<h1>CYBER SECURITY</h1>
		<h2><i>What is it?</i></h2>
		<p>Cybersecurity is a category of technologies with the purpose of protecting other ICT systems from
			cyberattacks, vandalism, and otherwise unauthorised use. ICT systems can range from appointment management
			at a doctor's office to apps such as Facebook.</p>
		<br>
		<p>It is more than just 'protection'; it is prevention. Cybersecurity technologies prevent malicious entities
			from committing cybercrimes such as stealing data and personal information or manipulating or compromising
			communications technology. They do this using many different forms of technology which are constantly
			changing and evolving to compete with the rapid evolution of cybercrime.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The state of the art, and future of cybersecurity, is automation. There are a plethora of different
			technologies and learning techniques that are arising to combat new and evolving cyber threats. One of the
			cutting-edge new technologies in cybersecurity is Artificial Intelligence (AI), and within it, Machine
			Learning. AI is more than just physical robots made to look, speak, and feel like us. AI is bringing a whole
			new complexity to cybersecurity, enabling greater measures of protection and prevention. Using machine
			learning to find and recognise data patterns and predict certain behaviours, professionals can take
			cybersecurity to a new level.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Specific machine learning techniques utilised are supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks and
			deep learning, and other hybrid learning techniques. Supervised learning is essentially taking raw data and
			applying an algorithm which references user-specified training data and desired output.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Unsupervised learning environments interpret unlabelled data with no guided algorithm and no desired output;
			it works independently. These types of programs do not search for a specific label, but rather, they will
			flag any anomaly or unrecognised pattern. This method is the future of cybersecurity due to its flexibility
			and adaptiveness.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Finally, there is deep learning or 'neural networks', the name coined as they are inspired by the human
			brain. Sarker et al. define deep learning as: <i>"A significant part of machine learning in AI that
				typically builds security models based on artificial neural networks consisting of several data
				processing layers."</i> (Sarker et al. 2020). Deep learning consists of several layers: input, one or
			multiple hidden layers, and output. Deep learning differs from regular machine learning in that they perform
			better with large data sets and complex data (such as sounds, images, text). However, it does take a lot
			longer to train a deep learning algorithm compared to machine learning. With these machine learning
			techniques, the art of cybersecurity is evolving, heading to an autonomous future.</p>
			<img class=borderless src="CYBER SECURITY.png" alt="Diagram of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning">
			<figcaption>Diagram of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.</figcaption>
		<br>
		<p>The future of cybersecurity can look grim, as the threat of cyberattacks is set to increase. However, there
			are technologies on the horizon which will change the game yet again. Quantum computing is a concept that
			has existed in infancy for a while now. Nevertheless, with quantum programming becoming more accessible, it
			is not unreasonable to guess that in the coming years new and improved quantum algorithms will become
			available.</p>
		<br>
		<p>It is suggested that quantum algorithms can lend support to current problems in AI, and vice versa. Quantum
			computers can process much larger and more complex algorithms, which could drastically improve the current
			state of cybersecurity protocols. It is possible that AI programs written with quantum programming could be
			more comprehensive. Cybersecurity measures incorporating AI and machine learning using quantum programming
			could be even more secure and in-depth than ever before.</p>
		<br>
		<h2><i>What is the likely impact?</i></h2>
		<p>The Cyber domain is rapidly evolving, and so it is an arms race to develop these up and coming technologies
			such as AI and quantum computing. It can easily fall into the wrong hands and could be used to develop
			advanced cyber threats. Currently, security consistently lags technology advancements, and the gap is
			getting larger.</p>
		<br>
		<p><i>"in 2010, there were less than 50 million unique malware executables known to the security community. By
				2012, they were double around 100 million, and in 2019, there are more than 900 million malicious
				executables known to the security community"</i> (Sarker et al. 2020)</p>
		<br>
		<p>With new machine learning programs and a future of quantum computing, the very infrastructure in which data
			is stored will be subject to change. Intelligent data storage will be a must, and our current ideas about
			infrastructure will need to adapt to these new technologies. There will most likely be a push for education
			of the public on Cybersecurity and cybercrime, due to predicted increases in cyberattacks.</p>
		<br>
		<p><i>"In the future, it is expected that: Attacks will become more opportunistic and difficult to detect or
				predict. Built-in threats will be become part of the landscape and be impossible to detect using current
				methodologies."</i> (Australian Government Department of Defence, Science and Technology 2014) </p>
		<br>
		<p>Currently, the Australian public has limited knowledge of what Cybersecurity even is, or how to protect
			themselves. Even small businesses are not equipped to defend themselves against simple email phishing
			attacks. </p>
		<br>
		<p><i>"In 2009 Scamwatch received 20 500 reports of scams, with losses of $69.9 million. By 2019 reports
				exceeded 167 000, with reported losses of almost $143 million." (Australian Competition and Consumer
				Commission 2020)</i></p>
		<br>
		<p>The demographic most vulnerable to an increase in attacks will be older Australians. According to the ACCC,
			<i>"People aged 55 to 64 reported higher losses than any other age group, with losses of $30 million."
				(Australian Competition and Consumer Commission 2020). Not only are older Australians more vulnerable,
				but they are also less interested in pursuing more knowledge on Cybersecurity. Out of Australians 50
				years and up, only 42% expressed interest in learning how to adjust their privacy settings. Further,
				only 29% wanted to learn how to pay safely online."</i> (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission,
			2020). Cybercrime is expected to get more sophisticated, and more frequent in the years to come, and with an
			estimated 28% of Australian's being 50+ years old, they will be more vulnerable than ever.</p>
		<br>
		<p>As with any conversation including AI, there is an unshakeable fear of job security, and that the AI will be
			making people redundant. However, AI in cybersecurity can never be perfect and by nature it is an easily
			abused technology. Humans will always have jobs in maintaining compliance in AI technology, so current
			cybersecurity professionals should not fear the future. </p>
		<br>
		<h2><i>How will this affect you?</i></h2>
		<p>For everyday people who are not either apart of or interested in the realm of cybersecurity: these changes
			may not be obvious. Automation of security protocols is very much 'behind the scenes'; however, the gradual
			effects of new and improved security will be evident with time. Even the most seemingly simple malware
			detection software will be improved and become even more thorough. This most basic protection should become
			more accessible to those who are vulnerable to cyber threats. AI in cybersecurity will also allow
			professionals more time to closely monitor for more sophisticated threats, knowing that with machine
			learning their programs are able to learn and protect themselves. </p>
		<br>
		<p>In daily life, I foresee changes to my approach to personal data, and my confidence in companies handling my
			data. As someone who wants to pursue a career in cyber security, the prospect of AI incorporated into
			security is both an intriguing yet concerning one. As mentioned previously, AI is an easily abused
			technology with infinite unexplored avenues. I think the threat of malicious cyber threats will become even
			more apparent, and the Australian attitude towards cybersecurity will change. There will be more of a focus
			and push for educating the public of possible cyber threats/warning signs. The future of war itself is
			moving from traditional warfare, to cyber warfare, and believe national policies and initiatives will
			reflect this.</p>
		<br>
		<p>As a future cybersecurity professional, I expect many challenges in these new technologies, we are on the
			cusp of innovation in this field, and it will require ingenuity to combat future threats.</p>

		<h1>CLOUD: SERVICES & SERVERS</h1>
		<h2><i>What is it?</i></h2>
		<p>Cloud services and servers in today’s age of computing technology are used to provide on demand availability
			of computer system resources, these include data storage and computing power. This is achieved by using
			dedicated data centres which can store large amounts of data accessible via the cloud. This in turn allows
			the end user, whether that be a business or for personal computing, to access the infrastructure without
			having to pay, or significantly reduce the up-front cost of physical infrastructure.</p>
		<br>
		<p>There are numerous service models available to be able to provide the technology to the user, these are, and
			not limited to, IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service, PaaS – Platform as a Service & SaaS – Software as a
			Service. These services create a virtual environment as opposed to a physical environment. The most widely
			accepted definition of cloud computing is that you are running your workload on someone else’s computer. To
			allow this to work efficiently in today’s high demand, servers are in data centres which can be
			automatically allocated and will provision resources based on the client's requirement. Software as a
			Service offers cloud access programs such as Spotify or Netflix which can be accessed via web browser or
			mobile application. This is done by writing the code in SQL or alternate query language. When this is
			relayed to the user it is transmitted in JavaScript with HTML. </p>
		<br>
		<p>Today, state of the art data centres are built using extensive network fabric allowing the transmission of
			information in excess of 1 terabit per second (Tbps). In such data centres, the information stored is highly
			encrypted. This encodes the information and passes the encryption key to the user, enabling the user to
			access a readable version. What this allows users to do is store their information securely off-site,
			allowing on-demand access from numerous remote locations.</p>
		<br>
		<p>One of leaders of cloud storage and services is Google. Whilst a lot is mentioned about how the transmission
			of data is a core requirement to make these services effective. Google has also led the way in ensuring that
			the operation of the data centres behind this have been able to run using completely renewable resources. In
			Google’s 2019 environmental report they outlined how they matched 100% of their global electricity
			consumption with renewable energy.</p>
		<br>
		<p>As the demand for these services heightens, the need for more data centres will increase. It is expected that
			through continual implementation of new technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things) will become an
			important part of growing and providing these services. Using real-time analytics and machine learning,
			these clouds and servers are expected to be able to provide an improvement of cloud services to end user.
			Incorporating into this increased storage capacity, and enhanced performance of the internet.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Looking through the technologies that make all these possible, having available smaller storage hardware
			which allows the servers to store increased levels of data is an integral part of how these servers can
			provide the cloud services to the user. In addition to that there are numerous other considerations to
			implementing these services. This includes, ensuring the user can access an uninterrupted service by
			ensuring the data centres are geographically distributed over numerous regions, along with disaster
			protection and back up for the information stored.</p>
		<br>
		<h2><i>What is the likely impact?</i></h2>
		<p>The most notable large-scale impact of these services is the economic one. There are numerous layers to how
			this will impact the global but also local economies. On a larger scale Google’s new data centre in Europe
			had supported the creation of 9,600 jobs per year in the region, whilst also boosting economic activity in
			the region by EUR 8.8 billion GDP. On a smaller scale the effects this will have on developers' businesses
			and users will also be noticed. The ability for developers to use services such as Amazon’s Web Services
			(AWS) to create and store their developments of Amazon’s servers and use the cloud to provide these to a
			user. Businesses’ and corporations will also see an impact as the need for high upfront infrastructure costs
			will decrease, whilst also allowing access to a range of programs or storage on demand in a pay-as-you-go
			method.</p>
		<br>
		<h2><i>How will this affect you?</i></h2>
		<p>After looking at what the above services can provide in terms of accessibility and demand, there are strong
			reasons to suggest the impact on an average user in their everyday lives could have a lasting impact to how
			we access and communicate on the internet. Everyday usage of PCs will be transferred into the cloud, and all
			that an everyday user would need is access to the internet to get to work [10]. Whilst this would have an
			impact on the everyday user, there will be an impact on how businesses could operate, which would trickle
			down to the employee. If we can access and use all types of web-based applications on any PC, the ability to
			work remotely increases, changing how we go about our daily lives. This could entail a larger amount of
			work-from-home employment opportunities, creating a healthier work-life balance, increasing opportunities to
			connect with family and friends.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Another benefit of cloud-based applications and dedicated servers is the ability to store important data
			securely. Accessibility to virtualised learning experiences such as a school library and education services
			through learner management systems. What the cloud can provide through services such as SaaS & DaaS (Desktop
			as a Service), is a remote eLearning experience delivered through web-based applications. These systems
			provide the user with a virtualised desktop or classroom environment. What this could mean for an everyday
			user is the possibility to provide large quantities of academic content, with minimal cost of hardware,
			along with the ability to be able to access it from anywhere.</p>
		<br>
		<p>To conclude, as demand increases, it is integral to the longevity of cloud computing that the overall cost to
			the user is kept low, and that the services remain accessible 24/7, 365 days a year.</p>

		<h1>AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES</h1>
		<h2><i>What is it?</i></h2>
		<p>Autonomous Vehicles, also known as self-driving cars, are cars that have the capability of driving either
			themselves with no human input or driving with minimum human input. Not to be confused with Autobots and
			definitely not to be confused with Decepticons. However, if they were classed in the same manner Autobots
			and Decepticons would likely be classed as level 5 Autonomous vehicles under the SAE Autonomous level
			definitions.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Autonomous vehicles compared to automated vehicles use their wide array of sensors to monitor the changing
			conditions of the road and environment and its surroundings to safely navigate the terrain. Whereas
			automated vehicles rely heavily on artificial aids to assist the vehicles to navigate safely including
			magnetic strips or predetermined confined areas of operation. </p>
		<br>
		<p>There are five levels of autonomous vehicles:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Level 1 - No Automation</li>
			<li>Level 2 - Driver Assistance</li>
			<li>Level 3 - Partial Automation</li>
			<li>Level 4 - Conditional Automation</li>
			<li>Level 5 - Full Automation</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p>Some of the leading manufacturers of autonomous vehicles are Tesla, Google and Volvo. Tesla is still in the
			process of releasing autonomous trucks and was unveiled in November 2017 with production planned in 2021.
			This technology is pushing the competitors and technology. The following table outlines the different levels of Autonomy in vehicles.</p>
			<img src="AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES.png" alt="Graph of SAE levels for Autonomous Vehicles">
			<figcaption>Graph of SAE levels for Autonomous Vehicles</figcaption>
		<br>
		<p>Autonomous Vehicles use a wide range of sensors including LIDAR, radar, and optical sensing inputs among
			other senses to safely navigate and try to avoid accidents and collisions. The vehicles need to get from one
			destination to the next with little to no input from the user whilst driving. Autonomous vehicles have come
			a long way in the last decade and are currently available at the level 2 autonomous stage here in Australia.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>Australia has laws that determine how automated our autonomous vehicles can be. Whilst the vehicles have full
			capability of autonomous control in most cases Australian laws limit the vehicles to cruise adaptive cruise
			control, lane correction and automated lane changing automated as well as collision avoidance. </p>
		<br>
		<p>There are a range of different measures to ensure the drivers are still watching the road and are still able
			to take control of the vehicle if necessary. Recently it has been discovered the Tesla’s Model S and Model
			3’s internal camera situated in the rear vision mirror has the capability of monitoring driver's awareness.
			Originally, Tesla released the Model 3 and Model S with the internal cameras in preparation for an automated
			taxi service that was due to be trialled in America for anti-theft/graffiti management.</p>
		<br>
		<p>There are however limitations with the current driver monitoring solutions in place. Pressure sensors on
			wheels have been circumvented by careless drivers by taping potatoes to the steering wheel to simulate
			attentive driving. Internal rear facing cameras have difficulties tracking and monitoring eye movement if
			the user is wearing glasses or under less than ideal lighting conditions.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on GPS signal and electronic mapping technology. Most Autonomous Vehicles
			use Bayesian Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms. This system compiles data from real
			time sensors and stored electronic mapping to update the vehicles off-line map to safely navigate its
			surroundings.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Some of the limitations or difficulties autonomous vehicles have had particularly in Australia is Australia's
			natural fauna. Kangaroos are hard to detect as their movement is irregular at best. This has the possibility
			of causing accidents with autonomous vehicles as kangaroos tend to attempt to race cars and hop in front of
			them instead of just crossing the road. Other limitations that have been noted of are tumbleweeds both here
			and in the States.</p>
		<br>
		<h2><i>What is the likely impact?</i></h2>
		<p>Currently, the greatest limitation for self-driving cars - besides legislation - is developing AI to the
			point where the vehicles are as safe, if not safer than human drivers. The greatest limitation in
			navigational technology is GPS error accuracy. Currently, GPS has a typical error of ±4.9m. This may not
			seem that great of an error but considering the average road lane width in Australia is 3.5 metres, it could
			mean the difference between being in the correct lane and heading into oncoming traffic if other sensors
			fail to function as required. Emerging technology that could improve this error rate are the latest LSO
			commercial satellite networks that have been deployed recently. These satellites have the capability of
			providing reduced error down to a few centimetres.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Some of the potential impacts of this technology is that autonomous vehicles will improve productivity,
			reduce parking, reduce road accidents and reduce the need for parking in congested cities.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The potential disadvantages of autonomous vehicles follow suit with automating any form of industry. Truck
			drivers, taxi drivers and a wide range of delivery drivers may find themselves made redundant, having to
			retrain into other fields as automated vehicles start to become increasingly more accepted. There will be a
			great demand for skilled workers in the field of maintaining and building these technologies.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Another disadvantage of widely adopted autonomous vehicles is that they rely heavily on internet
			connectivity. This will inevitably present a cybersecurity risk and possible privacy concerns. With the
			owner's cars being consistently connected to the internet, it will be easier to track people down, and even
			easier for malicious individuals or organisations. Like the 2016 terrorist attacks in France, there could be
			similar attacks carried out with autonomous trucks without the risk towards the operator and even worse if
			the truck’s controls are hijacked by a remote hacker.</p>
		<br>
		<h2><i>How will this affect you?</i></h2>
		<p>This will impact on everyone in the community as the cost of delivering goods should drop with autonomous
			trucks and delivery vans at the least. Human driven taxies will be a thing of the past and trials have
			already begun in the US for this product. Google’s Waymo are currently in a limited area trial in Phoenix.
			Whilst there is a requirement for a human operator to be in the vehicle in case the driver is required to
			take manual control. Google’s Waymo is focused on taxi services and not on consumer available autonomous
			vehicles.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Even if you do not purchase an autonomous vehicle, the flow on effects will be noticed in everyday life.
			Eventually, the safety features of these autonomous vehicles once they are finely tuned will more than
			likely become mandatory features soon.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Travelling to and from work will not be so much a burden with the ability to conduct office work whilst in
			transit. People will inevitably move into more affordable outer suburbs with travel no longer being a manual
			timely task.</p>
		<br>
		<p>My mother and brother both drive for Uber so their jobs will be made redundant. This will result in months if
			not years of agony for myself and my other brothers as this will be all she will talk about is how unfair it
			is that “the robots took her job.” </p>
		<br>
		<p>My father on the other hand has a medical condition that soon will prevent him from driving and possibly even
			holding a licence. When autonomous vehicles become widely available and legally allowed to drive unlicensed
			passengers, it will benefit him greatly at the upmost annoyance of my mother.</p>
		<br>
		<p>On the rare afternoon when I am preoccupied with important business meetings at the Woolloomooloo bay hotel,
			I could send my autonomous vehicles to pick up my children from school and deliver them to me. Unlikely, but
			possible. The future is bright if you are not in the transport sector.</p>
