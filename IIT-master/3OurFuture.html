			<h1>OUR IDEAL JOBS</h1>

						<h2><b>Chris</b></h2>
							<t>My ideal job is a Game Programmer for Codemasters. This Job would require a good mix of formal and incidental learning. The role would be heavily focused on using the C++ programming language to develop the games produced. As the role requires experience in the areas of Object Orientated Programming I would be working more on the Programming side of the IT industry.</t>
						<h2><b>Rich</b></h2>
							<t>My ideal job would be an intelligence role within the Royal Australian Navy. This role would heavily incorporate cyber and data security. As a Naval Intelligence Officer (NIO), your core role is to deliver a wide range of intelligence in an easy to understand brief that provides information to command and other management entities. The role of a NIO is appealing to me as I have developed a keen interest in issues surrounding Australia’s national security and this role directly allows me to pursue this curiosity in promoting Australia’s vital interests. I am extremely interested in working in Australian intelligence, especially at a time when our regional and international security environment is rapidly changing, hence working in cyber intelligence for the Royal Australian Navy would be a highly rewarding role.</t>
						<h2><b>Nadette</b></h2>
							<t>My ideal job is a digital media marketer for Hive Gaming. In this position, a digital marketer will control all aspects of marketing a brand in the digital media sector. This involves creating strategies for marketing campaigns, looking at analytics to find a target audience, and creating content to appeal to the target demographic, and the ideal candidate needs to have vast knowledge in a variety of creative software.</t>
					</div>
					<div class="rightcolumn">
						<h2><b>Paul</b></h2>
							<t>My ideal job would be something like the junior software position offered by OCUIS working on unmanned surface vehicles. This would provide me with a position with a semi hands on role whilst also having a large focus on programming and testing of new technologies. Working on the ocean is a bonus as well as I enjoy sailing and would be able to use my prior experience within this role.</t>
						<h2><b>Kayla</b></h2>
							<t>After some more research and reflecting my ideal job has changed since Assessment 1. I’ve found rather than general IT consultancy, my ideal position would be as a Cyber Security engineer or similar title. A Cyber Security engineer designs and implements secure network and information solutions as defence against cyber threats. They also engage in penetration testing of these systems making sure defence is up to date and working. This position requires additional and consistent research to keep on top of the evolving technologies and threats in the security field.</t>
						<h2><b>Brandon</b></h2>
							<t>My ideal job would be a game development job, which involves various levels of programming and being comfortable with using Game engines and programs such as Unity and Unreal Engine and having the knowledge to use these programs to bring a game to fruition. I would love to work on both smaller games and AAA games as it would be a good experience to work with a team that can bring someone’s game idea to life as well as being apart of a team that has worked on various other AAA titles and learning from them and while working on the project.</t>

			<t>Below is a table we have created to exemplify what is similar and different among our chosen career paths.</t>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
			<t>Looking at this table, every single one of our jobs require communication. In the field of IT this is not an unexpected result, is quite a bit of teamwork and collaboration required. With this group project and future projects, we will all have plenty of practice in communication. Most of us will also require programming skills to succeed in our careers, which is something we can work on as a team and support each other. But of course, not all our careers are the same, we have an ample variety of unique skills that we will need to develop. Rich as a future Intelligence Officer, for example, will be collaborating with government agencies on a regular basis. Chris as a Game Programmer for Codemasters will need technical knowledge of motorsports to provide a realistic experience for their end user. Bernadette’s ideal job is quite a step away brining even more variety to our group, as a Digital Media Marketer she will require an eye for design and creativity to be successful.</t>
