			<h2>Aims</h2>
			<p>Our primary goal is to deliver a high quality, user friendly app to board gamers
				around the world. The app will be accessible across multiple platforms,
				it will be simple to use and have a strong focus on retaining the social
				dynamics of playing a board game with friends and family.</p>
			<p>As we progress through development of our app, we have set milestones and
				smaller goals that we aim for. This allows us to stay focused on making sure
				that we develop a fully functional application that is accessible for all ages.</p>
			<h3>Key Focus Points</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>A warm and welcoming interface, encouraging useres to interact through
					the boardgame</li>
				<li>Multi-device functionality</li>
				<li>Multi-game compatability</li>
				<li>Achieving a fully operational application by the due date</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Our team’s priority is to develop an app that assists Cluedo players mitigate
				the issues attaining to paper score cards.</p>
			<p>Throughout the process of developing the app, we will have many versions,
				both major and minor updates included. For major updates, we have planned
				for our version 1.0 to have a working login screen which connects with the
				AWS servers to store and retrieve user data. In this version we also plan to
				have the clue-keeping card fully functional, as it’s the most important feature
				at this stage in our project. In Version 2.0 we will move onto incorporating
				the Cards and the graphical elements associated to these to provide a much
				more detailed GUI experience. This release will have the cards stored on
				the app, along with using AWS’ GameLift to power the random allocation of
				the cards. Our Version 3.0 will have all the listed features above as well as
				the ability for users to send information to other players, for example the
				showing of the card based on a player guess.</p>
			<p>Once we have all these features and versions in place, the app will have the
				base code and design, along with the connectivity with AWS’ services to
				implement various versions of the game Cluedo <a target="_blank" href="3.0References.html">[1] </a> and
				other board game
				titles.</p>
			<h3>Interface</h3>
			<p>We aim to have an interface that opens correctly firstly developed for
				Android. The interface needs to be user friendly and provide users with
				intuitive functionality. All the main page buttons need to interact correctly
				and be in line with what users expectations. The user should be able to
				sign in with there chosen method be it via google or social media sign in or
				alternatively create an individual account not linked to the aforementioned
				socials. When the user signs in the app should have the functionality to
				recall the individuals game history including resuming play as well as the
				users saved preferences. One of the most important aspects that we
				will endeavour to focus on is the look and the feel of the app from the
				beginning sign on page. The most critical measure of success for us in
				the implementation of the app and its interface, is that we give the user a
				seamless GUI which easily transitions based on the request of the user.</p>
			<p>We need the app to be able to react in real time with AWS servers, sending
				and retrieving data to other users. The most critical measure of success for
				us in the implementation of the app and its interface, is that we give the user

				retrieving data to other users.</p>
			<h3>Multi-Functionality</h3>
			<p>We are aiming to develop the app initially for Android users as this is where
				our team’s current skill set sits to be able to produce the required code.
				As Java is used in the Android Studio SDK Manager <a target="_blank" href="3.0References.html">[2] </a>we
				can easily
				implement the base framework for the app. Once we have done this, we can
				use Xaramin <a target="_blank" href="3.0References.html">[3]</a> to translate the code for release to
				iOS devices. When the
				app is developed and meets this functionality the future releases and code
				development will become easier to update of the two App stores.</p>
			<h3>Multi-Game Capability</h3>
			<p>When our app is developed and functioning correctly, we will explore adding
				options to customise the layout of the scorecard making it applicable to
				other similar boardgames. Eventually with user feedback we will have
				different pre-loaded templates for specific games. Through the review of
				this feedback, we can implement additional features, along with taking
				suggestions from users on other board games that could benefit from this
				type of application. We have designed the app to not be just one dimensional
				for the game Cluedo, as we look to expand and not limit ourselves to a niche
				demographic of users.</p>
