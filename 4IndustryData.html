				<h2>How do the general skills rank in terms of employer demand?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>1. Kayla: Cyber Security Engineer</li>
						<li>2. Rich: Intelligence Officer</li>
						<li>3. Chris: Game Programmer</li>
						<li>4. Brandon: Game Developer/Technical Architect</li>
						<li>5. Bernadette: Digital Marketing Manager</li>
						<li>6. Paul: Software & Systems Engineer</li>
					</ul>
			<t>While the group has a modest amount of skills ranked for employer demand, it is highest in Rich’s ideal job of being an Intelligence Officer, and least with Paul’s job of System & Software engineer. With some job choices, such as Bernadette’s or Paul’s, there is less of a reliance on general skills. Performance and demand dictate that a heavier emphasis is placed on the IT specific skills associated with the job.</t>
				<h2>How do the IT-specific skills rank in terms of employer demand?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>1. Kayla: Cyber Security Engineer</li>
						<li>2. Brandon: Intelligence Officer</li>
						<li>3. Rich: Intelligence Officer</li>
						<li>4. Chris: Game Programmer</li>
						<li>5. Paul: Software & Systems Engineer</li>
						<li>6. Bernadette: Digital Marketing Manager</li>
					</ul>
			<t>Employer demand is greatest in specific fields such as Gaming or Intelligence, as a larger amount of staff are generally preferred for those careers, especially in comparison to more generalized or saturated fields such as Marketing. IT specific skills are required in our ideal jobs, with the highly desired skills not sharing a correlation with the employer demand. This is because a lot of IT specific skills are flexible and transferrable between career choices.</t>
				<h2>What are the three highest ranked IT specific skills that are not in your required skill set?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>1. SQL</li>
						<li>2. Project Management</li>
						<li>SAP</li>
					</ul>
				<h2>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>1. Organisational Skills</li>
						<li>2. Writing</li>
						<li>3. Planning</li>
					</ul>
			<h2>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h2>
				<div class="row">

					<h3><b>Brandon</h3></b>
						<t>After reviewing the Burning Glass, I still feel like my Ideal job would be a Game Developer, as I do have a passion for it and the demand for it seems to be reasonably average but quite high in the IT industry which would be a bigger focus for me and something I feel like I could accomplish with a bit of hard work and perseverance.</t>
					<h3><b>Bernadette</h3></b>
						<t>After looking at the Burning Glass data, I’ve gained further insight into my ideal job. With this in mind, it still hasn’t changed, as it caters further to my passions. I’ve already put time into developing these skills, as they are all things that I personally enjoy. That being said, there are clear challenges associated with the IT specific skills, that I believe I will overcome with experience. </t>
					<h3><b>Chris</b></h3>
						<t>After looking at the Burning Glass, the opinion of my ideal job has not changed. Combining the generic and IT industry relevant skills, I still believe that in the future employer demand for the skills I will need and have, will still be prevalent due to the social demand of the outputs of my ideal job.</t>
				</div>
				<div class="rightcolumn">
					<h3><b>Kayla</b></h3>
						<t>Ultimately, I did change my listed ideal job from Assessment 1, but that was because after further reflection; an IT consultant is not my end goal. It is more of a steppingstone towards a more cyber security focused role such as a cyber security engineer. My results have not changed my opinion on my ideal job, it only reinforces my desire to pursue the role, as it is deemed highly sought after.</t>
					<h3><b>Paul</b><h3>
						<t>Placeholder</t>
					<h3><b>Rich</b></h3>
						<t>Personally, I feel that the results from the Burning Glass exercise has drawn me closer to the position that I am aiming for. I am excited for the opportunity to continue working for this great country, and to expand my knowledge and experience in the field of defence.</t>
