		<h1>Skills and Jobs</h1>
		<p>Over the next 6 months we aim to have a refined rendition of our app, with
			both clue-keeping, scorekeeping, and card management available. It will
			be up on both Google play, and Apple app stores, with plenty of consumer
			feedback rolling in. In this time as we continue to develop our existing
			service, we will look into hiring new additions to the team to aid us. This will
			be especially crucial as we plan to extend our services into other games. The
			main roles we would be looking to add to our team are as follows.</p>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="leftcolumn">
			<h2>Project Manager</h2>
				<p>Our project manager will manage communication between team members, ensuring that 
				everyone is on the same page. This position will involve direct communication with 
				employees as they will organise workflow between staff members, coordinate meetings, 
				and maintain a comfortable work environment. Experience with leadership and management 
				techniques will be needed for this position, as you’ll be taking the head of meetings, 
				and ensuring that everyone completes their work by the specified deadline.</p>
			<h2>Junior Game Programmer</h2>
				<p>Our junior game programmer will work in direct support of the Brogrammer. Their role 
				will be to write and implement graphical and functional elements of code into the app. 
				The ability to be self-motivated and have strong technical problem-solving skills will be 
				essential to be able to interact with the already established team. As the development of 
				the app uses C# & C++ languages, are proficiency in these areas will be essential.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="rightcolumn">
			<h2>Security Engineer</h2>
				<p>The safety of our consumers’ data is one of our top priorities in Ex Machina. As a Chief 
				Security Engineer, you’ll be in charge of implementing security solutions within our products 
				as you conduct risk assessments and identify/eliminate vulnerabilities in our app. If you have
				experience with a variety of security products such as firewalls and virus protection, and are 
				ready to work in a fast-paced business environment, this is the job for you.</p>
			<h2>Creative Director</h2>
				<p>This is a key position in bringing this project to life, as you'll be the deciding factor in 
				everything from colour palettes to font choice. If you think that image should be shifted a few 
				pixels to the right, then it’s your call to make! You’ll be responsible in setting an appropriate 
				aesthetic to match our vision, ensuring that a high-quality product is produced, that is accessible 
				for all audiences. We’re looking for someone who’s proficient in creative design to elevate our brand; 
				bonus points if you’ve got experience with the Adobe Creative Suite.</p>
