		<h1>Project Description</h1>

		<p>After receiving feedback from Assignment 2, our group is determined to start work on what is remarked as
			being a unique and easily expandable idea.</p>
		<p>Through deep planning and market research, we have begun the build of a new app, an app that will mitigate
			lack of score sheets across a range of board games. Our first target is for the game Cluedo. Our team are
			working hard towards delivering a fully functional app that takes away the need for physical score cards.
			This app is driven to keep the game rolling, without taking away the social dynamic of playing a board game
			with your friends or family.</p>
		<p>As you can appreciate, there are thousands upon thousands of board games available. With our project open
			ended, we plan to add new games as they are released and continue to digitise the classic board game
			experience.</p>
		<p>Not only is this project viable in the real-world market, it also follows the current IT trend of cloud
			computing <a target="_blank" href="3.0References.html">(2021 IT (Information Technology) Industry Trends
				Analysis | Business of Technology | CompTIA
				2020) </a> and provides our members valuable experience and opportunity to develop key skills needed for
			our
			ideal careers. Cloud computing for example is a key skill required for both Paul and Kayla, as System
			Engineer, and Cyber Security engineer as their respective career choices. This project also gives Rich an
			opportunity to show experience managerial qualities, and Bernadette will be able to develop marketing
			strategies and develop a portfolio. As a prospective game programme, Chris will find many opportunities to
			develop his coding and software knowledge.</p>

		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<h3>Topic:</h3>
		<p>Our project idea is to develop and implement an app for use on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store,
			which would replace the score sheets and clue cards when playing the board game Cluedo. The game will be
			able to keep track of each game you play, making it a more effective method of being able to keep track of
			what cards you were dealt along with being able to make off options you have ruled out in the current game.
		</p>

		<p>The ideal outcome for the app would be to have a functional replacement for Cluedo score cards and
			clue-keeping sheets initially. We will then look at developing further functions such as random card
			shuffling and distribution amongst players, as well as storing the case file cards.
		</p>
		<h3>Motivation:</h3>
		<p>The motivation behind this idea is that many people worldwide still enjoy the social experience of playing
			board games with family and friends, is that they find that pieces of the game constantly go missing. The
			biggest issue specifically for the game of Cluedo is having to re-print pages upon pages of scoresheets to
			replace the sheets already consumed. Nowadays, board games have been uploaded to the internet allowing a
			much larger opportunity of players, trying to combine the useability of mobile phones and the social
			togetherness of playing board games is the driving motivation behind the idea. By doing this and creating
			the app, we are looking at following trends of having a companion app for board games to incorporate the use
			of mobile phones. Many game titles played on PC or console have a companion app used to track transfer and
			monitor game progress. What we aim to do is provide a similar service to a different demographic of users.
		</p>
		<h3>Landscape:</h3>
		<p> While researching the current environment for boardgame apps and other score keeping apps. There seems to
			only be a select few apps of quality and popularity. In regards to Clue/do specific apps there is one that I
			could find, <a target="_blank"
				href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/clue-solver-for-clue-or-cluedo-board-games/id555233356">‘Clue Solver
				- for Clue or Cluedo board games’</a>, from publisher Brady Anderson on the app store.
			Released in 2012, the only reviews seem to be negative stating the app was buggy or freezes often. With no
			updates in last 8 years I would say it is not much in the way of competition. The only other app I found
			similar to our own and with any sort of popularity is a game score keeping app called <a target="_blank"
				href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hfd.scorepal&hl=en&gl=US"> ‘ScorePal’</a>
			published
			by HappyFaceDevs on the google play store. The last update to this game was in 2018; it also has
			positive and recent reviews by users. Our advantage over this app would be our in-game mechanic support
			(such as card management and clue keeping). </p>
		<p>After investigating the current landscape, we have devised a new goal, which is to provide regular and
			consistent updates. Doing this should provide ample incentive to new users, compared to the competition and
			the lack of recent developments. With the current environment reasonably untouched, should we release this
			app I believe there would be little to no competition.</p>
