        <h1>Scopes and Limits</h1>
        <div class="container">
            <p>As we review the overall scope of the project, we understand we will have certain limitations to what we
                can implement within the initial project period up to week 6. As we are looking to develop an
                application which not only serves the basic functionality of replacing a scorecard in Cluedo, which
                would be our initial release of version 1. In v1, we aim to be able to provide an experience much more
                immersive which will incorporate card sharing amongst various other features. As we progress and add
                additional features to the app, we aim to be able to develop the app in a way which allows incorporation
                of numerous versions of not only the game Cluedo, but with the intention of being able to deploy for
                other board games, some of which may be considered Retro; our goal is to revitalise the experience of
                these games. As we progress through these steps will be able to show potential stakeholders how our app
                has a market value for a moderate demographic of users.
            </p>
            <p>Initially we will not be able to release a full version of our desired app. We considered using Monaca <a
                    target="_blank" href="3.0References.html">[1]</a>
                as our initial development tool, however, after much consideration and review we decided to use
                Xaramin <a target="_blank" href="3.0References.html">[2]</a>and the Android SDK studio <a
                    target="_blank" href="3.0References.html">[3]</a>. As we chose
                this path to begin our venture, our app will be
                released first to the Google Play Store <a target="_blank" href="3.0References.html">[4]</a>leaving an
                opportunity for the future development for the
                Apple Store<a target="_blank" href="3.0References.html">[5]</a>. Although we aim to initially release to
                Android devices, this provides us with the
                opportunity to show the usefulness of our app. </p>

            <h2>Code/App Develpment</h2>
            <p>After review of feedback given and extensive research into finding a suitable cross platform developer,
                we have decided to use Microsoft’s Visual Studio version 16.8.1, Android.Sdk.Manager version 4.1.1 &
                Xamarin version 4.8.0 <a target="_blank" href="3.0References.html">[1] </a>. With this we will be
                provided with a single, cross platform API (Application
                Programming Interface) to develop code to be used across iOS and Android <a target="_blank"
                    href="3.0References.html">[2]</a> using C# as the language.
            </p>
            <p>Xaramin extends .NET with tools and libraries designed specifically for building apps on iOS & Android.
                Microsoft’s Visual Studio and Xaramin are free and require no licensing costs. We will use these
                development tools along with GitHub to opensource and code we may require.
            </p>
            <p>To use this we will need access to a Desktop computer or laptop with access to the internet. As the
                developer tools we will be using can be used on either Windows or macOS there will be no requirement to
                use a dedicated operating system.

            <h2>Storage/Connevtivity</h2>
            <p>To store user information and records we will use Amazon Web Services (AWS) Mobile app Backend <a
                    target="_blank" href="3.0References.html">[3]</a>to
                access Amazon Cognito User Pools. This will allow users of the app to sign up and sign in to the
                application. Here is a diagram from Amazon depicting their cloud database structure.
            </p>

            <figcaption>[Fig 1] (AWS Mobile App Backend with Hybrid Apps | Amazon Web Services 2016)</figcaption>
            <p>We will use AWS GameLift to manage the servers and allow interconnectivity of the game. As our app
                requires interaction between multiple devices in real-time, this is a core component to ensuring the
                viability of the product. We aim to achieve this by using the Amazon GameLift SDK Version 4.0.2 <a
                    target="_blank" href="3.0References.html">[4]</a>.
                Below is a basic database diagram from AWS GameLift. </p>

            </figcaption>
            <p>As we are using a cloud-based solution to store and connect users we do not need any physical hardware to
                achieve this. We have, however, considered that we will need our own database to store on AWS we
                designed a very basic data structure of our own. This covers our most necessary information such as user
                IDs, game IDs, account data, and history. </p>

        <h1>Testing</h1>
        <div class="container">
            <p>Our app will go through continuous testing throughout the design and build process. During the build, the
                app will be debugged and trialled as if it was available on the app store. Our commitment to developing
                a functional and engaging app needs to be closely reviewed to confirm that we are on the right track. We
                will be focusing on accessibility, future game compatibility and overall design. We’ll put our app
                through testing phases: Alpha and Beta. The Alpha phase will be closed off to friends and family and
                will ideally include users both with and without Cluedo experience, as well as a variety of ages and
                confidence levels with technology. Doing this we ensure a varied testing pool, and a more inclusive and
                accessible end product. During testing we have developed our own metrics in addition to taking
                suggestion from Todd DeCapua, the Executive of JP Morgan who states that “-it is important to gather
                both front- and back-end metrics. Client-side measures are vital to understanding the front-end user
                experience.” <a target="_blank" href="3.0References.html">(DeCapua 2015)</a></p>

            <p>
                To this end we have this list of metrics to test for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Application response time</li>
                <li>App crashes</li>
                <li>Data retrieval and storing accuracy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In-app deduction logic accuracy After our closed Alpha, we’ll be pushing the app into an open Beta,
                where anyone who has been following our development will be able to download and test it, providing
                feedback accordingly. When fully released, our feedback will be gained through the number of individual
                downloads, along with app reviews after people appreciate the uniqueness of the app.
