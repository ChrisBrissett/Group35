					<h3><i>How long have you been working for this business?</i></h3>
						<p>"4.5 years."</p>
					<h3><i>Have you changed roles during your time of employment?</i></h3>
						<p>"Three times. Started as an intern (3 months), cybersecurity analyst (3 years), cybersecurity services manager (1 year to 1 and a half)."</p>
					<h3><i>What is your current role in the company and what does it entail?</i></h3>
						<p>"Practice Manager – I lead a security operations centre that has several cybersecurity analysts around Australia. I also manage implementations, provide level two support to analysts, and conduct presales (demos and presentations for prospective clients).
							<br>
							<br>
						<p>Part of my role is to collect data from different systems to define anomalies."
					<h3><i>What kinds of clients/customers do you work with?</i></h3>
						<p>"A good range of customers including insurance, big banks, corporate and departmental, government, airlines, secure hosting services and charities/not-for-profit."</p>
					<h3><i>Do you travel around a lot? If yes, is this frequent?</i></h3>
						<p>"Not now, but before, I travelled a fair amount, depending on the quarter. Sometimes, I would be travelling 3 or 4 times a month or even more, due to clients being interstate."</p>
				</div>
				<div class="rightcolumn">	
					<h3><i>What do you find most enjoyable about your job?</i></h3>
						<p>"Two things – going after new clients and providing a proof of concept or a demo. Other one, is more technical, involves understanding data from the system, and determining whether it’s malicious."</p>
					<h3><i>What do you find most challenging about your job?</i></h3>
						<p>"Working with people. Those demo/client engagements are the most challenging part. I have been conducting demos for the last two days, working with people from the company and with clients. There is a lot of preparation involved in a two-day demonstration."</p>
					<h3><i>Would you recommend your position to other people?</i></h3>
						<p>"Yes, but it depends on what you like doing. If you don’t enjoy talking to clients and managing their expectations, this isn’t the best role for you."</p>
					<h3><i>What is the ratio of working/talking to clients and talking to your own team?</i></h3>
						<p>"It depends on leads. For most of the year, it’s 50/50, but right now, there’s a high volume of new clients and opportunities, shifting to more 70/30; mostly talking to clients."</p>
					<h3><i>Would you say that most of your time is spent maintaining a system already in place, or developing?"</i></h3>
						<p>"Now, it's maintaining, two years ago it was the opposite."</p>
