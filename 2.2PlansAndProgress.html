		<h3>Where We Are Now</h3>
			<p>The app began as an idea to replace paper scoresheets and cards. The
				motivation to get this idea up and running was the constant battle of trying to
				hide your scoresheet from other players, with giant cubby houses of boxing.
				The idea was initially to get a functional app for use on mobile devices that
				could supplement the aforementioned. Using the accessibility of mobile
				devices, we looked at a basic functional app that could achieve this.</p>
			<p>The story for our project begins prior to Week 1, with Chris having the idea to
				create a digital companion app for board games. Chris developed the start of
				this idea in his first assignment, then when we all came together as a group
				for assignment 2, as Ex Machina, we took it upon ourselves to bring it to life.</p>
			<p>We began our project with a total of six members in Week 1, however, we
				concluded there was an imbalance in the contributions amongst team
				members. While conflict-resolution was attempted with the specific team
				member in question, we were unable to come to a satisfactory conclusion,
				and we had to exclude them from the group going forward. Unfortunately,
				this change in our roster shifted our initial timeline for the product
				substantially, as the work of six people had to be split upon five. While we are
				still picking up the pieces, we are back on track with our projected progress
				thus far, despite losing a member. This has only gone to prove how persistent 
				we are as a team, and how well we work together as a singular unit.</p>
			<p>During the first few weeks of any project, a time to plan and prepare is
				essential. Week 1 for our team was about developing a very basic plan, with
				pencilled designs and concepts to help brainstorm how we were to approach
				the project ahead.</p>
			<p>In the second week, we had achieved some clear plans on the direction that
				we wanted to take to develop a functioning app at the end of the project. It
				allowed each department to further plan in their fields retrospectively and
				prepare for the pre-design and build phases. When our project idea was
				first conceived, we had the idea of having multiple board games within the
				application, however, this proved to be too ambitious for the time period
				and resources at our disposal. We came together early on during the project
				and decided to tone down the scope of our project, instead, creating an
				application to support a singular board game instead of multiple. This game
				that we decided on was Cluedo, and there was a clear resonance in the group
				as we came to an agreement. It is the perfect canvas and example for our
				idea, and we’d love to branch into other games eventually. With our focus
				changed, we proceeded into week 3.</p>
		<h3>How It Has Progressed</h3>
			<p>Going into week 3, and Assignment 3, we started to really delve into the
				details and nuance of our project, both the front and back end. As our team
				progressed through the first few weeks, we were able to better grasp goals
				and targets that we wanted to achieve. Our brainstorming period allowed us
				to focus on the company’s focus and what we wanted to have in front of our
				clients at the end of the 16-week project.</p>
			<p>In this time, we encountered another complication during the development
				phase of our project. Initially, we were torn between creating an Android exclusive 
				app, and one that would support cross-platform – the choice of
				development studio was dependent on this decision. Eventually, we settled
				on Xaramin, as we would be able to produce a product that was compatible
				with both Android and iOS. This is because one of our most important
				values that guide us is inclusivity; we want everyone to be able to use this
				application with their loved ones, regardless of application. While there was
				a brief learning curve for the software, the developers quickly got their heads
				around it.</p>
		<h3>Where We Are Now</h3>
			<p>We are now approaching the 9th week of our project, which means we are
				well on the way to a fully functional app.</p>
			<p>We feel sure that we are on track to deliver a fully functional product. We
				have a plan, and each member of our team is focused on their tasks. We
				are up to week 9 of our 16 week plan and have the app framework coming
				together.</p>
			<p>Most of the creative assets have been created for the application, our
				funding pitch, as well as our social media branding. Further planning for
				marketing is to be done within this next week, as we explore further into the
				interests of our audience.</p>
			<p>As we review our progress up to and including the current weeks plan, we
				have established a functional user interface and clue-keeping sheet in the
				Alpha stage which the user can interact with. As we progress further into the
				project, we aim to incorporate a more cohesive User Interface before launch.</p>
			<p>After completing several rounds of internal testing for key UX and QA
				metrics such as application response time and app crashes, we will soon
				be releasing a version Alpha to a closed group of users to test further. Week
				9 is here, and our development team has worked hard to achieve a working
				platform that is approaching inhouse testing. Our next major hurdle is
				achieving the right look and feel with the user interface before we release the
				app for inhouse testing.</p>
			<p>After about 6 weeks of hard work and dedication, our team have arrived at
				our goals and are on track for the remainder of our project term. Up and
				coming is the remainder of the build, with our team working hard on the
				applications functionality. We have begun reaching out for our alpha testers
				for the closed environment testing phase which is due in roughly 4 weeks'
				time. This testing phase is essential to the success of our application.</p>
			<p>With our hearts set on having this app multi-functional across a plethora of
				games, our current project is being built with open ended code, allowing us
				to copy the features to other games in the future. Our Product Manager is
				working closely with some big-name brands on introducing their game to the
				app soon. These are exciting times!</p>
