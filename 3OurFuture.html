		<h1>Ideal Jobs</h1>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="leftcolumn">
				<h2><b>Chris</b></h2>
				<p>My ideal job is a Game Programmer for Codemasters. This Job would require a good mix of formal and
					incidental learning. The role would be heavily focused on using the C++ programming language to
					develop the games produced. As the role requires experience in the areas of Object Orientated
					Programming I would be working more on the Programming side of the IT industry.</p>
				<h2><b>Rich</b></h2>
				<p>My ideal job would be an intelligence role within the Royal Australian Navy. This role would heavily
					incorporate cyber and data security. As a Naval Intelligence Officer (NIO), your core role is to
					deliver a wide range of intelligence in an easy to understand brief that provides information to
					command and other management entities. The role of a NIO is appealing to me as I have developed a
					keen interest in issues surrounding Australia’s national security and this role directly allows me
					to pursue this curiosity in promoting Australia’s vital interests. I am extremely interested in
					working in Australian intelligence, especially at a time when our regional and international
					security environment is rapidly changing, hence working in cyber intelligence for the Royal
					Australian Navy would be a highly rewarding role.</p>
				<h2><b>Nadette</b></h2>
				<p>My ideal job is a digital media marketer for Hive Gaming. In this position, a digital marketer will
					control all aspects of marketing a brand in the digital media sector. This involves creating
					strategies for marketing campaigns, looking at analytics to find a target audience, and creating
					content to appeal to the target demographic, and the ideal candidate needs to have vast knowledge in
					a variety of creative software.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="rightcolumn">
				<h2><b>Paul</b></h2>
				<p>My ideal job would be something like the junior software position offered by OCUIS working on
					unmanned surface vehicles. This would provide me with a position with a semi hands on role whilst
					also having a large focus on programming and testing of new technologies. Working on the ocean is a
					bonus as well as I enjoy sailing and would be able to use my prior experience within this role.</p>
				<h2><b>Kayla</b></h2>
				<p>After some more research and reflecting my ideal job has changed since Assessment 1. I’ve found
					rather than general IT consultancy, my ideal position would be as a Cyber Security engineer or
					similar title. A Cyber Security engineer designs and implements secure network and information
					solutions as defence against cyber threats. They also engage in penetration testing of these systems
					making sure defence is up to date and working. This position requires additional and consistent
					research to keep on top of the evolving technologies and threats in the security field.</p>

		<figcaption>Ex Machina Ideal Jobs Comparison</figcaption>

		<p>Looking at this table, every single one of our jobs require communication. In the field of IT this is not an
			unexpected result, is quite a bit of teamwork and collaboration required. With this group project and future
			projects, we will all have plenty of practice in communication. Most of us will also require programming
			skills to succeed in our careers, which is something we can work on as a team and support each other. But of
			course, not all our careers are the same, we have an ample variety of unique skills that we will need to
			develop. Rich as a future Intelligence Officer, for example, will be collaborating with government agencies
			on a regular basis. Chris as a Game Programmer for Codemasters will need technical knowledge of motorsports
			to provide a realistic experience for their end user. Bernadette’s ideal job is quite a step away brining
			even more variety to our group, as a Digital Media Marketer she will require an eye for design and
			creativity to be successful.</p>

		<h1>Career Plans</h1>
			<div class="row">
			<div class="leftcolumn">
				<h2><b>Bernadette</b></h2>
				<p>I believe that our career plans are quite different across the group, with my ideal job still being 
				that of Digital Media Marketer. This is due to a personal interest in community interaction, mixed with the 
				IT components involved in content creation. The only common elements between our jobs are that of communication, 
				and the IT aspect.</p>
				<h2><b>Chris</b></h2>
				<p>Looking at the Career plans of the group there are some contrasting career paths members of the group will look 
				to undertake. These range from the front-end marketing of digital media, to hard coding of programming of games and 
				systems. Whilst there is the difference in the career paths we wish to explore, there are certainly some common 
				aspects of skills required in the IT industry. All our projected career plans involve working as a group or team 
				environment, as the skills in demand of communication and teamwork are so prevalent in the industry today, working 
				together in a group for 8 weeks has put us all in good stead to develop and attune these skills for use once we step 
				into our desired profession.</p>
				<h2><b>Kayla</b></h2>
				<p>While comparing all members’ ideal jobs, one commonality is that they all require communication. In the field of IT 
				this is not an unexpected result, is quite a bit of teamwork and collaboration required. With this group project and 
				future projects, we will all have plenty of practice in communication. Most of us will also require programming skills 
				to succeed in our careers, which is something we can work on as a team and support each other. But of course, not all 
				our careers are the same, we have an ample variety of unique skills that we will need to develop. Rich as a future 
				Intelligence Officer, for example, will be collaborating with government agencies on a regular basis. Chris as a Game 
				Programmer for Codemasters will need technical knowledge of motorsports to provide a realistic experience for their end user. 
				Bernadette’s ideal job is quite a step away brining even more variety to our group, as a Digital Media Marketer she will 
				require an eye for design and creativity to be successful.   </p>

				<h2><b>Paul</b></h2>
				<p>xxx</p>
				<h2><b>Rich</b></h2>
				<p>After reviewing our team members future career plans, I acknowledge that we are all going in different directions but 
				feel that there are many common skills. Skills such as effective communication, leadership and teamwork will be required 
				in each member’s future jobs. I personally feel that working closely with our team over the last 10+ weeks has been a 
				great way to continue to develop my interpersonal and communication skills and I feel very grateful for this opportunity.</p>
				<p>My plan of joining the Intelligence wing within the Royal Australian Navy has not changed. I am still on track to joining into 2021.</p>
