            <p>We as Ex Machina, have decided that we will be defining roles for each of
			our members. This is because we all have very specific skills that we already
			excel at and have skills that we’d like to improve upon. In addition, we believe
			that dedicated roles in this project will help to give a clear and concise
			direction for each member to focus on.</p>

		<h3>Social Sensei (Product Manager) - <i>Rich</i></h3>
			<p>A product manager’s role is to focus on the planning and execution of the
				overall product being delivered. From the start of conceptualisation, to the
				finished product, this role covers all areas to confirm that the product will be
				delivered in a timely and cost-effective manner. The highest priority for this
				role is to keep the product on track and aligned with the company’s goals and
				morals.</p>
		<h3>Brogrammer (Game Designer) - <i>Chris</i></h3>
			<p>You’ll be working with your fellow team members to design the core aspects
				of the game and be a key member in bringing our vision to life. This position
				will involve working closely with our creative and software team as you
				design the core aspects of the game, and they implement your ideas into
				reality. You’ll be taking care of the logistical side of things, designing the
				graphics, animations and layout for our app. You need to be an innovative
				thinker, and quick to adapt to new situations.</p>
		<h3>Technical Evangelist (Software Technical Lead) - <i>Paul</i></h3>
			<p>The technical lead role is crucial in developing a successful product and
				comprises of bringing together and overseeing the team of technical
				personnel. As with any lead position one of the most challenging part of
				developing is the co-ordination of different creative aspects. Specifically
				focusing on the development our application from a software and creative
				perspective gives rise to a lot of challenging problems that can call for some
				creative solutions.</p>

		<h3>Director of First Impressions (QA & UX Manager) - <i>Kayla</i></h3>
			<p>The application we’re developing is ultimately to serve the user and their
				goals. Therefore, the user experience is our top priority. In order to achieve
				what we would consider the optimal user experience, one of the most
				important things is a bug-free application. This is where quality assurance
				and testing come into play. As QA & UX Manager I will ensure throughout
				every stage, our app is being tested for the best quality and experience. This
				also means organising testing groups and any alphas, betas, etc.</p>
		<h3>Comic Sans Annihilator (Media Coordinator) - <i>Bernadette</i></h3>
			<p>As Media Coordinator, you’ll take full control of the creation and content
				posted to Ex Machina’s social media accounts, along with the creation of a
				brand package that can be used by any other content creators or businesses.
				If you’re someone who has experience with copywriting, an eye for graphic
				design, and are interested in taking the helm of an entire brand/application,
				this is the position for you. You’ll interact closely with the Creative Team to
				digitally grow our brand by identifying our audience and creating content
				to appeal to them. You’ll also be assisting the creative team with creating
				assets for our product.</p>
