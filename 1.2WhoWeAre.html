		<h2>Group Processes</h2>

				<h3><b>Bernadette</b></h3>
				<p>For assignment 2, I was a member of Ex Machina, and I’m really looking forward to working with the
					group again for
					Assignment 3 and 5. I believe that we worked extremely well together, always meeting deadlines, and
					putting in effort
					towards completing the project. Unfortunately, one of our members was lacking the same drive as the
					rest of us, but we
					were able to pick up the slack.</p>
				<h3><b>Chris</b></h3>
				<p>During assignment 2 group work with Ex Machina, I found it to be a very enjoyable experience for
					someone who doesn’t love the concept of group work. I found our consistent communication during the
					whole process made for a cohesive and enjoyable experience I believe we found a very good balance of
					personality types within the group which allowed us to achieve our goals, and to a standard that we
					expected our ourselves. Moving forward I feel are more detailed approach to group meetings will
					benefit our team. </p>
				<h3><b>Kayla</b></h3>
				<p>Working with Ex Machina in assignment 2, I think we all had specific goals for what we wanted to do
					and were very good
					at identifying and working to everyone’s strengths. Unfortunately, one of our previous members
					lacked motivation and initiative
					despite our attempts to include them; they regrettably can’t join us for the next project. Going
					into our next project I believe
					our stricter approach to meetings and tasks will help to clear up expectations of all members, and
					the group. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="rightcolumn">
				<h3><b>Paul</b></h3>
				<p>It was great working with Ex Machina in Assignment 2 as we were all so motivated, except for one of
					our members who won’t be joining us for this project. We communicated well throughout the assignment
					and timelines were set accordingly and everyone found themselves in positions that contributed well
					towards the outcome. I think our updated meeting times will accommodate some of our team better.
				</p>
				<h3><b>Rich</b></h3>
				<p>During assignment 2, our group was very active and worked quite well together. Unfortunately, we had
					one member that did not
					lift his weight, so moving forward we have one less member. Our communication was effective and
					focused. Microsoft Teams was a
					little frustrating, and we used Discord for most of our communication and catchups as it was a
					common tool used by all members.</p>

		<h2>Career Plans</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="leftcolumn">
				<h3><b>Bernadette</b></h3>
				<p>I believe that our career plans are quite different across the group, with my ideal job still being that
					of Digital Media Marketer. This is due to a personal interest in community interaction, mixed with the
					IT components involved in content creation. The only common elements between our jobs are that of
					communication, and the IT aspect.</p>
				<h3><b>Chris</b></h3>
				<p>Looking at the Career plans of the group there are some contrasting career paths members of the group
					will look to undertake. These range from the front-end marketing of digital media, to hard coding of
					programming of games and systems. Whilst there is the difference in the career paths we wish to explore,
					there are certainly some common aspects of skills required in the IT industry. All our projected career
					plans involve working as a group or team environment, as the skills in demand of communication and
					teamwork are so prevalent in the industry today, working together in a group for 8 weeks has put us all
					in good stead to develop and attune these skills for use once we step into our desired profession.</p>
				<h3><b>Kayla</b></h3>
				<p>While comparing all members’ ideal jobs, one commonality is that they all require communication. In the
					field of IT this is not an unexpected result, is quite a bit of teamwork and collaboration required.
					With this group project and future projects, we will all have plenty of practice in communication. Most
					of us will also require programming skills to succeed in our careers, which is something we can work on
					as a team and support each other. But of course, not all our careers are the same, we have an ample
					variety of unique skills that we will need to develop. Rich as a future Intelligence Officer, for
					example, will be collaborating with government agencies on a regular basis. Chris as a Game Programmer
					for Codemasters will need technical knowledge of motorsports to provide a realistic experience for their
					end user. Bernadette’s ideal job is quite a step away brining even more variety to our group, as a
					Digital Media Marketer she will require an eye for design and creativity to be successful.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="rightcolumn">
				<h3><b>Paul</b></h3>
				<p>Having considered the career plans of our team it is evident that there are a wide variety of different
					paths that we all are looking to pursue and there are a lot of common skills. One of the key attributes
					that really stands out is that all our career paths require meticulous attention to details. I still
					plan on heading towards my ideal job and are progressing with my career plans still.</p>
				<h3><b>Rich</b></h3>
				<p>After reviewing our team members future career plans, I acknowledge that we are all going in different
					directions but feel that there are many common skills. Skills such as effective communication,
					leadership and teamwork will be required in each member’s future jobs. I personally feel that working
					closely with our team over the last 10+ weeks has been a great way to continue to develop my
					interpersonal and communication skills and I feel very grateful for this opportunity.

					My plan of joining the Intelligence wing within the Royal Australian Navy has not changed. I am still on
					track to joining into 2021. </p>
