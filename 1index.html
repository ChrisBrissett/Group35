				<h3>Kayla</h3>
				<p>My name is Kayla, I am 21, living in Mackay, QLD. I am a high school graduate, working in sales and
					purchasing specifically in the mining and industrial sector. My hobbies include music, art, TTRPGs,
					logic puzzles and PC gaming. </p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>I'm interested in IT as a whole because of its omnipresent nature; This is both intriguing and
					terrifying to me. I am enthusiastic about educating and protecting dthe vulnerable, but I am also
					passionate about innovation; I believe there is always a more efficient way to do something. One
					field that has always captivated me is Ethical Hacking. I think it encapsulates my main goals quite
					well, those being education, protection, and innovation.</p>
				<h3>Chris</h3>
				<p>My name is Chris Brissett, I am 31 and work as an operations manager for an industrial supplies
					company. I am an avid gamer and can spend hours upon hours in front of the Xbox or PC playing
					numerous titles. I also have a passion for Formula 1, and one of my favourite hobbies is attending
					open mic comedy nights and getting up on stage and telling jokes. I have a great interest in the
					programming aspect of IT, including web, app and game development.</p>
				<h3>Nadette</h3>
				<p>My name is Bernadette Wong and I was born and raised in Sydney. I’ve always had an interest in IT,
					which stemmed from a childhood love for gaming. This led to an eventual passion for Esports, and the
					internet helped me connect with people from all around the world, which sparked an interest in
					Dungeons & Dragons as well after witnessing a few livestreams on Twitch TV and YouTube. In terms of
					IT experience, I spent a brief time in a social media marketing position, and briefly wrote for an
					Esports journalism website on the side.</p>

				<h3>Rich</h3>
				<p>My name is Richard, I grew up in Adelaide and worked in IT for 7 years before joining the Navy. I am
					Australian, speak English as a primary language and am learning German. In July 2012, I was
					implanted with two Philips HiTagS (RFID) that I use for access to my home and various other
					applications. This was a result of my identity being stolen and used across Europe to manipulate my
					identity and gain access to personal financial accounts.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>My interest in IT started when playing with computers from a young age. I have always been interested
					in building computers, to exploring new technologies and learning more about them. I intend to join
					the intelligence wing in the Navy to put my skills to use and learn more in the ever-evolving cyber
					world.</p>
				<h3>Brandon</h3>
				<p>Hello, my name is Brandon Ferguson, I was born and raised in Geelong. I used to work at McDonalds and
					completed VCE at North Geelong Secondary College in 2016. In my leisure time I hang out with friends
					and like to play video games which as a kid has sparked my interest in IT. Since then I have been
					doing different things with computers mainly game related such as creating private servers for games
					I loved. But other than that, I don’t have much experience and have never worked in the industry.
				</p>
				<h3>Paul</h3>
				<p>My name is Paul Bryant-Smith, I am originally from Rye on the Mornington Peninsula, VIC. I moved to
					Sydney 13 years ago for my job in the Navy. I am an electronics technician specializing in Air
					Search Radars. I have been interested in IT from a young age since my dad showed me that could edit
					the code for nibbles to change the settings in Q basic.</p>
